## About This Site

In May I realized my website [had been hacked](https://twitter.com/caseyg/status/209773035539013633) and for some time had been been redirecting visitors to a set of shady Russian domains. After finding out that this encrypted line of bullshit had inserted itself into 6561 different PHP files on my server, I backed everything up and hit Delete All. I thought I would put everything back up in a few days, but found myself sucked into a never-ending secret project to make the new website of my dreams, while learning more about things I'd been meaning to, like Git and Javascript. I started tinkering in Brooklyn, New York in May 2012, kept working on it in Charlottesville, Virginia while visiting my grandparents for a week, and finally launched it in Espoo, Finland a few months later in late August.

### Philsophy

#### Multiple Views

There are four ways to look at things:<br /> <a href="/graph" rel="tooltip" data-original-title="Grab and throw tags and things around to grok their connectedness. Might crash your computer." data-placement="left">Graph</a>, <a href="/archive" rel="tooltip" data-original-title="A straightforward listing with utilities for sorting and searching." data-placement="bottom">Archive</a>, <a href="/infinite-scroll" rel="tooltip" data-original-title="If you want to sit back and not thing too hard about things.">Infinite-Scroll</a>, and <a href="/narratives" rel="tooltip" data-original-title="Arcs.">Narratives</a>. 

#### Fighting Time: Streams, Rivers, Timelines vs. Graphs

All the projects on this site are tagged with people, places and concepts that tie them together.

A force-directed graph is perhaps not the most practical way to sort content by tag.

#### URL Structure

The old

#### No Analytics

After installing [Ghostery](http://ghostery.com) and seeing how many sites include upwards of ten tracking scripts, I decided to stop collecting analytics on my personal sites entirely. When I visit a website and see that Ghostery has nothing to report, it feels like an electric shock of not-giving-a-fuck! Statistics are closed is the new comments are closed. It just feels useless and sometimes stifling to think about my personal site in terms of numbers. I wasn't really doing anything with said numbers except committing them to memory and worrying about them a little. I will miss seeing referrers (who is linking to my website) but I will not miss wondering why nobody is visiting my website.

My dream personal website statistics application would collect specific kinds of information intentionally. It would ask users if they want to identify themselves with a name and a home url. It would show them their own tracks across my site as I am collecting them, and they could comment on how it went. Maybe that's a stupid idea. But as far as I know this type of explicit, friendly collection of visitor information doesn't yet exist. 

Typekit may embed a Google Analytics script, but it's not one I have access to.

### Technical Details

#### Stacey

This site is built with [Stacey](http://staceyapp.com), a content management system built by [Anthony Kolber](http://aestheticallyloyal.com/), that is so wonderfully simple I have not changed my mind about using it for all this site's various incarnations since 2010.

The biggest reason I like Stacey is that it uses no database* or backend interface. This means that instead of logging in to a web interface (like with Wordpress or Indexhibit) to add new projects or update existing ones, I just throw text files, images, and other media into [neatly organized folders](https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com/tree/master/content). Stacey slurps up everything in these folders and runs it through [templates](https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com/tree/master/templates) to spit out a website.

I don't like using most web interfaces because I start to obsess over how bloated, ugly, and distracting they are. With Stacey I can just use any text editor. Because my content and templates are just a files in folders I don't feel locked into a particular system. The databases on sites powered by Wordpress and others sometimes make me feel like I have no exit.

That said, for this iteration of my site I wanted to treat the site more like a database than ever before. This required some Javascript wrangling.

* As my friend David Yee pointed out to me once, a file system _is_ a kind of database.

#### Git and Github

Building this site is my first attempt in earnest at using Git. In conclusion, I will never not use it again! Git is a lifesaver while working [EXPAND ON THIS], and it also allows for lots of cool benefits.

- You can browse [the source code for this entire website at Github](https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com). 

- You can see a detailed log of changes to this site by looking at the [commit history](https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com/commits/master).

- You can browse every version of every single file on this site and [compare revisions](https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com/commit/21b598146d7480cc98419bfbb2f6bdb304b3b73b#diff-5).

- You can fork this site (make a copy of the entire codebase) and use it as a template for your own site. You can fork this site and change a few words and images to make a full-featured parody in five minutes. If you see something wrong you can fix it yourself and submit a pull-request on Github, then I can merge your code into this site with one click. 

#### Javascript

This site also represents my first real attempt at writing Javascript. [The file](https://github.com/caseyg/caseyagollan.com/blob/master/public/docs/js/sneezeburg.js) is named after [my dog](https://www.facebook.com/sneezeburg) because he is also cute but also hideously ugly and unkempt. There is a metaphor there somewhere I think. I am embarrassed by this code, but it works (KIND OF) and I want to get better at it over time.

The [Graph](http://caseyagollan.com/graph) is powered by [D3.js](http://d3js.org) by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/). In trying to make an interactive force-directed graph I also dragged myself through experiments with [Arbor.js](http://arborjs.org) by [Christian Swinehart](http://samizdat.cc) whose work I very much admire, [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com), and [Kinetic.js](http://www.kineticjs.com) before landing on D3. I am very happy here.

The [Archive](http://caseyagollan.com/archive) relies on [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) by [David Desandro](desandro.com).

#### SASS!



#### Other Tools

Most of the code was written in SublimeText 2 with [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) syntax highlighting. I had Codekit running in the background to compile SCSS into CSS, and minify both CSS and JS as I worked. Fonts are served from Typekit.
