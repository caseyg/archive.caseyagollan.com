title: Week 9

date: 2012 Mar 29

content:
Tuesday night we went to Ippudo for dinner, which was awesome, and then Aaron took over my Facebook for an hour when we got home. I watched in horror and amazement:

Wednesday was weird. After writing the previous weeknote I spent all day _not doing_ my design homework, which was to make a magazine. It's not like I don't think about this all the time. Maybe I think about it too much. Instead of working on it, though, I was having pretty interesting Twitter banter with @dvsch about [Khoi's latest post on digital magazines](http://t.co/1xtcwCCl) and reading [Robin Sloan's latest](http://www.robinsloan.com/fish/): a "tap essay" which is, of course, smart. I don't know why I get so procrastinate-y about design homework but I think I was annoyed at having to think about and work with print (which is like SooOOoO obsolete—jk, maybe), and apathetic about having to come up with a themed interest and do things a certain way. Design assignments and I do not get along. Went to Baoguette with Alex and got a sandwich with Thai chilis so spicy I almost blacked out, then showed up to Warren's class at 6pm with _nothing_ for the second week in a row. And the worst part was that I felt...serial killer calm. Pretty sure the appropriate response in a situation like that is to be freaking out. Felt like I shouldn't talk because I talk too much anyway and I brought nothing to the table so I was a little quiet, but got a lot out of seeing other people's progress.

Thursday is hard to remember. Had a decent art history class in the morning. Then just kind of looked at the internet for a long time:

Browsing aside, I think my biggest accomplishment was responding in center-aligned emoji poetry to an email from Youngna about how well things are going with Girl Walk and passing along some thanks for the website.

Had the first really good sculpture class in a while, interesting discussions and lots of work to talk about from people. Got a milkshake, bought groceries, and went home.

Friday: did laundry, then walked over the bridge with Alex, then _finally_ turned in a proposal for my Censorship term paper. I'm actually pretty excited about it because I can just babble about computers:

&gt; I propose writing my final paper on bias in computer systems, or the (many) problems with how computers affect access to information. This is a logical continuation of my first essay, which unpacked money’s role as a form of information and the potential for it to therefore become “censored.” Computer bias, which still on the fringes of traditional censorship studies, has amassed a good amount of academic sources, and there are, of course, many familiar and historical points of entry: from the subtly biased interface design of the Sabre electronic airline ticketing system popularized in the 80’s which caused profits within an industry to shift overnight, to the currently unknown long-term effects of today’s sudden proliferation of recommendation algorithms for all aspects of life: from dating to movie watching. The paper hinges on quiet forms of censorship which can be hard to detect and are sometimes unintentional,. After preliminary research, I have come to the conclusion that the two best way to grapple with this problem are educating designers to be aware of computer bias, and educating users to approach computers more critically. While honing in on specific examples such as the Sabre system, Netflix, and OkCupid, I hope to touch broadly on interface design, algorithms, history, and education.

Saturday was back in Rye for a quick doctor's appointment and grabbing all my clothes which I forgot at home after break. I noticed a tweet from one of my childhood BFFs about Metro-North when I was on the train, and then we realized we were on the same train!! But we somehow missed each other at Grand Central.

Saw this mushy Occupy tag on Metro-North. Bleh!

Went to school and climbed on the building because the weather was nice. Everett took this from afar, lolol:

Kengoe and Bryson came over and we all hung out and screamed Bieber late into the night.

Was introduced to Katy Perry's new video, which is offensive/horrifying(/possibly brilliant?):

I can't tell if the military thing is just like a really stupid metaphor but it seems really zeitgeisty. What war is that?? Normandy?? Just creepy and insulting to women (she joined the Marines because of a breakup??), but I would totally put this in a history book. Did the military pay for this shit??

Sunday went out with Alex to get new shoes, since my boots no longer had laces at all and the weather is getting all summery! Ended up walking around for hours, going into every shoe store and a bunch of fancy stores. Stopped for a really good lobster role, because soho was getting to my head, and then got a sort of ridiculous pair of white shoes at David Z. that look like something a Euro person would wear to a nightclub or golf club in 2004. Whutevs.

Read the internet a lot again:

So much of my work recently has involved writing things on screen, and it's made me feel exhausted, distracted, and strained, so Monday morning I bought a pack of loose-leaf and some pens, and laid out five different projects on my desk. 

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nefoSvJ11qzrmn8.jpg)

Despite setting up a structure that I thought would be conducive to ADD, jumping between tabs, in a way, I ended up focusing on design and got almost totally caught up on my responses to our class readings so far. Also got a lot done in terms of figuring out what I want to make a magazine about. 

Kept writing for a while:

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nemazAH31qzrmn8.jpg)

Then took a nap, and was awoken from a nap with a rant streaming in over DMs about Curator's Code—which was awesome. Somebody reads this shit? And they want me to expand on something? Done. More on this soon.

Back to work: what was freaking me out was that I thought we had to make a whole magazine, when in reality we only have to do a few spreads to demonstrate the execution as a kind of portfolio piece. Part of me has a hard time designing something if I have to fake it and the only content is Lipsum text, but another part of me also has a hard time finishing things. When I reframed the assignment as a project I was allowed to start and not finish I suddenly had terrific momentum. Reading all our class readings about "designers as authors" and how desktop publishing and the internet are changing design, I started trying to articulate what a magazine could still provide in a world where the tools to do everything as individuals and the networks to effortlessly distribute things to people are at our fingertips. So the form should deal with this meta-concern about publishing. In terms of content: one of the strongest threads throughout the things I read and think about is the design of what goes on screens. Left to my own devices (pun) I'll sit around all day fiddling with new things and breaking them. My roommates make fun of me for being a paid spokesperson in disguise, like in the Truman Show:

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BhIIPbO_6xg" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Part of the reason I like Wilson Miner's talk [Why We Build](http://vimeo.com/34017777) is because it finally armed me with a defense against that joke. He asks: "What is your time-to-screen in the morning? 5 seconds? 30 seconds? We're not just making pretty interfaces, we're in the process of building an environment where we'll spend most of our time for the rest of our lives. What do we want that environment to feel like? What do we want to feel like?" Designing for the screen, and poking around on it all day, can sometimes feel like just pushing pixels or being part of Facebook's evil plan, but I believe this actually _is_ the world we inhabit. Maybe that's a fucked up thing to think, but everyone I ask about their time-to-screen has said five seconds or less.

So: a journal of screen architectures. Boom. I started culling and collating the best things I had read online recently about designing screens and imagined inviting the authors to expand beyond blogposts. Now this became something I REALLY WANT TO DO. Here are a bunch of leads pulled from my Pinboard to flesh out the first issue: [Kevin Kelly wants to pay you to read his next book](http://blog.findings.com/post/19346681104/how-we-will-read-kevin-kelly), <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/110081/Buzzing-about-network-graphs">Why haven't we seen a picture of the whole <strike>earth</strike> internet yet?</a>, [Stephen Wolfram's over-examined life](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/), [Robin Sloan on constellational thinking](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/5579) (these are some of the best ideas I know of out there, but the posts actually leave something to be desired...here is where expansion and editing could come in), [Mandy Brown on Deploying content](http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/deploy/), [The Social Graph is Neither by Maciej Ceglowski](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/11/the_social_graph_is_neither/), [the image object post-internet by artie vierkant](http://language.cont3xt.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vierkant-imageobject.pdf), [my mother was a computer by n. katherine hayles](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3622698.html), [charlie lloyd's angry reverie on software](http://basecase.org/env/Facebook).

Additionally, I started thinking about weird formats and strategies for making print content out of screens. What would it be like to publish a week of BERG London's mailing lists, from which they generate their amazing [link posts](http://berglondon.com/blog/tag/links/)? I want to see people go through and annotate their recent linkroll (I've been enjoying [@rogre](http://pinboard.in/u:robertogreco)'s, mostly for the insane tagging), what about some kind of [collaborative/track changes authorship](http://dismagazine.com/discussion/29786/club-kids-the-social-life-of-artists-on-facebook/) (though I'm depressed by the outcome of that instantiation...)? How could trolling be an editorial strategy? As I've enjoyed the [light](http://twitter.com/ftrain/statuses/179565012795404289) [trolling](https://twitter.com/#!/Mike_FTW/status/180144424767078400) of Curator's Code, recently.

Got sushi and went to bed, but didn't fall asleep until late.

Tuesday morning ran into Joanne on the subway, which was like a sign from the universe (and her) that I should wrap up those essay ideas and send them her way.

Then had photo. Christine started class by saying she felt super weird about last week's crit. After some probing from a few people in class she kinda turned to me and was like, "your work really threw me off. We should talk." So _that_ was nerve-wracking, but also felt kind of exciting. She told me that she knew taste shouldn't be a part of it but she really didn't like my work. I told her that I was kind of pulling a cop-out by showing SweatyTube, which was never supposed to be a "piece," though I still feel it's closer to my interests in photography than wandering the streets with a black and white camera in search of moments or whatever. We talked through a lot of stuff for half an hour, outside in the sunshine.

Christine felt too like it might've been a mismatch of audience for an inside joke, which I agreed with. She said she felt like I have to guide the viewer a little more, and that I wasn't really in it at all. Which I disagreed with. I told her about the funny comparison between a hyper-fabricated minimalist cube and a website that people can't grasp the process or authorship of. Impenetrable! I had achieved Larry Bell-dom, and all I felt was confused. Again, a weird conversation because SweatyTube really might not have that much to it. 

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nww1VPuW1qzrmn8.jpg)

It was kind of scary and exciting when Christine mentioned not being in the work because I've been dealing [literally](http://caseyagollan.com/2010/not-in-my-work/) with that phrase for a long time. 

When I started giving myself a harder time, getting in the way of my work, or lacking narrative/heartstrings/touch was when shit started getting REALLY interesting for me. Work before I started questioning work was a totally different kind of naive. Since then it's been a majorly recurring and strengthening theme for me. Christine was like, you know why writers drink so much right? Because it feels horrible to sit alone in a room and put yourself out there. (This completes the trifecta of all three of my studio teachers being like, you should drink! see also: "if you're stuck on a design, print it out, have a drink and take another look" and "you don't need an excuse to drink in sculpture class!" Oh, art school.)

After having sooooo many conversations about this with every class and teacher I've had in the past few years I totally see how the work I make (when I manage to _make_ it) and questions I ask come across as cynical, removed prototypical defensive mechanisms. The work gets mixed in with the defense mechanisms for me, but I can't help hovering in this meta-space. I hope it's not purely some immaturity that I get over when I'm 30, like Christine and others have suggested. I'll be pissed if there isn't something here. Professors who claim to love failure and then wonder if I'm getting in the way of myself? Hello, I fail HARD. But maybe slow and quietly. It's not something to intervene in, it's something to push. 

I still get all confused. 

But I could say with more confidence this time that the problem is the content. The systems and structures and platforms and archetypes are what I'm interested in prodding at. Even Kevin and I butted heads about this, when he insisted that the way to sell people a system was by telling a story about it. It's just not how I think. And while Christine is apparently "flatlining"(!) when she sees the lack of _something_ in my work, I sort of flatline when I see horrible ideas executed brilliantly. A straightforward series of big beautiful portraits just isn't that interesting to me in terms of problems I hope to push at, even if the human gaze is the most complex thing in the world, or whatever.

I felt unresolved and pried open in a good way. It feels like we leveled out in a helpful way to each other, and perhaps the most interesting thing I took away was the possibility of working in every direction at once. If sensitive photographs or boring portraits make me want to gouge my eye out, maybe instead of running away from or attacking them, I should actually be tearing in their direction, too. To get a better understanding, firsthand.

I kind of felt like these pugs:

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9uuqXXT7VYo" frameborder="0"></iframe>

And then I was thinking about negotiating these long running threads in my work as knocking antlers with myself. A slow fight.

<iframe width="500" height="254" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wsyed4Weu0M" frameborder="0"></iframe>

This too:

I skipped Censorship, because I hadn't gotten around to extending that proposal into a draft and we were going to be workshopping. Miraculously it was cancelled! Hanna Exel showed up to openings, was great to see her and her family for a few moments. Hung out for a long time in the studio with Tyler and xD.

Wednesday morning I grabbed a stack of looseleaf, sat down with a coffee, and drafted an editorial statement for Infinite Scroll, which is what I'm thinking of calling that magazine. Still very in the works. And it's not much of a strategy to republish other people's blog posts, so there's a lot of work ahead:

It has been suggested that designers might have to add imperfections in at random, or somehow file down the edges, or risk falling into a typographic uncanny valley. Or, more likely, it is us who will adapt to this sharpness, as the first film audiences ran out of the theatre screaming, for fear of being hit by an oncoming train.

Still very scattered, yes. But I kind of powered through a first iteration of design. Here are [Dribbble sized](http://dribbble.com/CaseyG) peeks:

I started thinking about qualities of screens or opposites. If screens are glassy and light emitting, maybe the magazine should be printed on soft, light-absorbent BLACK VELVET. Maybe I'm going crazy. Still haven't landed on whether or not it makes sense to imitate/mimic screens or complement them by opposing them, but I'm having fun. Excited to work more on this, actually. Right now it pretty instantly telegraphs a computer-y shlockiness with a little bit of what somebody described as "how-do-you-stomach-that-irony." But I like that. There is a goddamn pop up ad on the cover! Going to play more and then Kickstart this shit lolol.

Again, went to bed right after class, beat. This week has really been super successful in terms of putting my head down and digging myself out of the bit of a hole I was in. And projects are moving along with gusto on all fronts! So lots on my plate but no complaints.

Tonight will be co-showing SweatyTube again in sculpture, this time with Aaron. Who knows how that will go, it's a very different group dynamic.

Then knocking items off my to-do list before bussing down to Baltimore this weekend with the roommates, where Aaron has a show opening and we will get to tromp around with Natalie! Yay.
