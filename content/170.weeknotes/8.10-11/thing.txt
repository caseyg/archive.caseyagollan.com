On Thursday I showed SweatyTube again, this time to my sculpture class, kind of with Aaron (except he didn't say a word). It was a totally different vibe than the first time around in Christine's photo class. Mostly, I think, because Bea had brought more than enough wine, pop rocks, and rock candy for the entire class — leftovers from her show — and I went last. So the lights went down, a bootyshake video went on…on a sweater, and people laughed. Instead of babbling I kept my mouth shut and people threw out suggestions for the next video. Again we talked about the limits of memes: you get it or don't and laugh for a sec and then it's over. How they're the sort of thing that doesn't go very far and you don't return to. Keep thinking about a thing Tyler said in photo that I might've twisted, but: part of why they're funny is because the joke refuses to end. But people also looked closer than in my photo class: Maddy brought up how compositional everything looks, which I think is a big part of it too: generated but compositional. Niki wanted to know if I am swimming with a rubber ducky floatie in a sea of nihlism. Or what the internet means to me. I didn't answer right then except to mumble that it definitely isn't just a sea of nihlism for me. 

Just salty water.

Friday morning we grabbed just out of the oven Calzone things from Napoli bakery on Metropolitan Ave., which were unreal. And then we headed over to catch the Boltbus to Baltimore. We were bored [so we all trolled Boltbus](http://storify.com/caseyg/trolling-boltbus) on Twitter. I am happy they chose not to respond. I have still never been on a plane where I have wifi, but can you imagine how passive agressive you could be?? The sky is the limit, as they say. 

Also got a ton of sort-of-overdue work done on The Freelance Project and sent off a slowly uploading comp just as we hit B-more. It's very helpful to be trapped in a seat with slow internet for a few hours.

This was my second time coming to Baltimore. But even when I've passed by on Amtrak towards Granny and Grandpa's in Virginia there's the same horrible emptiness. So much built up unoccupied space. Disorienting, coming from New York. You can see how Baltimore was glamorous in a past life.

Natalie met us at the bridge where Boltbus drops off. YAY. Running hug. And then we walked to meet some of her friends and get sandwiches. Then off to a mall, which I guess is pretty Baltimore, but also pretty much everywhere-except-New-York-City. So that was nice. I also had about $10 in my bank account, not enough to widthdraw cash and scarily low to use a card, but was owed a back amount of utilities and split dinners and whatever, so I was hitting up the bank of Aaron and Alex all weekend. Half funny and half a hassle for all involved. Alex bought me those weird awesome mall pretzel bites. Went to two openings that were kind of whatever but interesting to check out the scene.

Saturday morning we snuck into MICA's dining hall for breakfast, which felt awesome because I'm so horrible at playing it cool. Ate weird gross dining hall food and [debated whether they put laxatives in it](http://www.snopes.com/college/admin/laxative.asp). Hitched a ride to Value Village, where Bank of Alex bought me a ridiculous shirt and cap. Aaron got a nice shirt for his opening. Alex got his typical horrible things. Walked around MICA for a bit and then headed downtown where we ended up at…another mall. The South Street Seaport of Baltimore, basically. Got burgers and fries at Five Guys and sat by the water.

Then hobbled to the other side of the water and onto a hill. Then walked down into a different area of Baltimore that felt kind of like a college town or something. Feel asleep on the bus on the way back to Natalie's. She took a picture and bedazzled it on some amazing iPhone app that is like Pika Pika.

Aaron's opening at [Nudashank](http://www.nudashank.com/exhibitions.html) was cool. His work looked good:

And I liked these videos by [Alan Resnick](http://alanresnick.info/):

This girl sitting outside was, like, blogging IRL in a Moleskine about the show. Don't _think_ it was a piece.

Went back to Natalie's and watched Mariah Carey's cribs episode. Which is just really worth a few minutes of your life.

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xcs9tUiMlmQ?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Then went to a party that turned out to be some freaky, fratty no-pants thing. So instead we sat outside. I would be fucking terrible at being a college student, if that's what it's supposed to be like. Ran into Suzy from back in RISD days.

Sunday Morning grabbed a bite to eat and got on the bus to New York. Walked up to dad's, showered for the first time in a few days, which was awesome. Took a cab in the rain down to Nom Wah Tea Parlor. Dad and Niki were mad at me for dragging them out in the rain but then we all had fun. Niki started crying when I brought up college. Forgot how much high school sucks and how stressful that whole situation was.

Survived April Fools Day with no pranks. Didn't even really notice any online ones.

Don't really remember Monday, except that I did a bunch of [Reading](http://reading.am/CaseyG) online.

Tuesday pretty much everyone showed up a few hours early to Photo to look at and talk about work, which was okay.

Then we headed down the the [Municipal Archives](http://mtprawvwdorlna1.nyc.gov/luna/servlet/RECORDSPHOTOUNITARC~19~19). The building itself is worth a visit, just to see the marble lobby. I feel like they used to design building interiors darker. I can't think of dark modern architecture…it's almost like architects don't consider darkness an option today.

Michael Lorenzini, the photo curator there, gave us an overview of what kinds of things they have in their (gigantic) collection. They get each mayor's things after they leave office, so there are a lot of photographs touting improvements around the city. His speciality is this one photographer, Eugene de Salignac, who single-handedly documented a lot of city maintenance and construction — bridges in particular — but had a much sharper eye than straight record keeping calls for. They're publishing [a book of his work with Aperture](http://www.aperture.org/books/browse-by-photographer/s-z/new-york-rises.html) that looks really good.

Other highlights of the collection are two huge sweeps of New York intending to capture every single tax lot. Effectively Google Street View before there was such a thing. A massive undertaking with bulky old cameras. Apparently they are gearing up to do it again? Seems kind of unnecessary when those images basically exist. Made me excited for when street view will not only allow you to navigate space but also time. It's potentially already possible with the documents in the Municipal Archive, it would just need to be hooked up!

Another amazing part of their collection is the NYPD's archive of crime scene photographs. Tons of fascinating gruesome shit:

![](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ehz1m8kC1qzrmn8.jpg)

The crime scene photos are an interesting resource because in the margins of their primary subject (dead bodies!) are a glimpse at the interiors of crime scenes: New York's shady, rundown underground. Places too poor to be recorded for their own posterity.

Then we went down into the conservation lab, a clean but dingy basement in this impossibly lavish old building. We met a lady trying, with a scalpel, to finagle open a document stuck to itself. Michael and some colleagues showed us old negatives in various states of decay. They handled things a bit less gingerly than I experienced on our trip to the NYPL archives and also seemed a little less stuffy in general. A really fun group of archivists to hang out with.

Skipped Censorship for real this time, since it was cancelled last week and I still hadn't written my draft. Went to openings and then worked in the computer lab until late on Infinite Scroll.

Woke up on Wednesday, got to school at a reasonable hour and hustled on design. Bought a bunch of speckled paper from the copy shop. Got a velour paper and a metallic cardstock from NY Central. Worked until class just on putting together more pages.

Pretending they had no idea what the magazine was already about (even after weeks of group crit) Warren asked the class to say what they each magazine is about and why. Which turned out to be more helpful than I thought it would, because it made clear which parts of the design telegraph certain aspects of what it's about. It also kind of helped pin down what the content comes across as being, which was pretty much what I wanted: an academic design journal crashing into internet art and culture.

It's far from done, even as far as the class assignment goes, let alone the whole magazine (not required but now I'm kind of into it). Not to mention the content is basically being ripped from people I have followed and bookmarked without any sort of consent, some headlines refer to things that don't even exist, and editorially things could stand to be clarified. Not sure what some of the things I wrote down on the cover actually are, or if these things benefit from being hypothetically packaged together. Also, showing progress with iPhone snaps is kind of pathetic because a big part of it was dealing with the physicality of a magazine: so speckled papers, acetate overlays, waxed pages, velour, and metallics don't come across well.

Talked with Ioana after class about how much work it is to accomplish so little with publications. Especially working solo. But I like it. Then went straight home, exhausted but excited. Did nothing but couldn't fall asleep until really late.

So, Thursday I overslept Weinstein. Mom showed up to drop of Sneezeburg before her and Niki headed to Florida to look at colleges and beaches. But first found outdoor seating in Brooklyn and had Mexican food with mom and pup. Walked Sneeze over the bridge and to school. Tried walking in with him and was stopped by a guard. Tried to sneak him in inside a bag but the guards were on to me so I just sat outside. Missed Niki's class but chatted with her outside after class was over about ways to sneak him in. She's really good at that.

Friday stayed home and worked next to the world's laziest dog, which made me feel productive. I've wanted a new, more comprehensive website for a while, since mine is really out of date at this point and just feels wrong. So I built a new Stacey template, did major data entry to get updated project information into it, and worked on the styling. Also figured out a way to manage revisions of writing and projects, which is super exciting. Want to add back in some of the crazy tag filtering and connector line things I was working on over the break, take a final pass at content, then this is ready to go.

The other nice part about having a dog around is that it forces me to take walks. Walked by this weird futuristic medical storefront that seems like it's from Eternal Sunshine or Being John Malkovich.

Worked on The Freelance Project late into the night, extending the mockups made on the way to Baltimore to a few more pages and then jumping right into a coded prototype covering most of the site.

Saturday, walked Sneezeburg up to Greenpoint. Got coffee and a bagel. He got really tired because the walk was so long, and I think I've been keeping him a lot more active than he is in the suburbs, so I had to carry him home the last couple blocks!

Finally sent essay proposals to Joanne. They're a mess but it's a huge relief to have sent something…anything out. Already thinking of revisions, additions, clarifications, where before there was just procrastination. Some 3500 words on social network parasites, sinister computer vision, tools for forgetting, github, skeuomorphism, curator's code and xanadu, and frictionlessness.

Really good call about The Freelance Project. Soon it will be an actual website and I can talk about it by its name. Excited for the project in general, as it's a cool idea, so I'm happy to have a hand in launching it. Going to try some more exciting or avant-garde design ideas, since I kept these versions pretty Dribbble-y. Stay tuned for more on that.

Had interesting Twitter banter about Ted Nelson with @AlexisMadrigal, @Litherland, @ftrain, and @tealtan. It basically led to writing down the Bobst call number for Literary Machines and watching this video in horror.

Went to a fun party hosted by some architects with Alex. Danced all crazy and jumped on their couch, etc. and so on until late.

Sunday, napped all day with Sneeze. Read a good thing [clarifying the history](http://sangamithra.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/on-amateurs-and-access/) of paid education at Cooper Union:

&gt;It appears that the original [paid] amateur classes were less about creating access for the poor than they were about allowing access for the wealthy, who were not held to the same rigorous standards as the students who attended for free.

Pretty much debunks one of the ways that President Bharucha has weaponized the school's history against its own ideals!

Finally read [Bruce Sterling on The New Aesthetic](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/). Really good. Though nothing could prepare me for the borderline annoying onslaught of New Aesthetic stuff in the coming week.

Jessia lent me The Poetics of Space and The Arcades Project came from Amazon. Overwhelmed by big dense books. Tried to read Poetics of Space twice and got through three pages each time before drifting back into a nap.

Watched [Why Are You Weird](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dod34d_tDeI&amp;list=PL2399D7EB6E015984&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C46de1ddFDvjVQa1PpcFMv61u8KxD9Aw81M-fc_W5jEDWGiyir-M8=) with Alex on the projector he got. (Yay!) It's funny if you have a love/hate relationship with art school.

Monday, walked across the bridge with Sneeze and Alex. Got Literary Machines from Bobst! One of three copies in NYC, which I have until June. Sat outside all day and read slowly and distractedly. (Though the book is supposedly non-linear.)

Played with Sneeze and he made a lot of friends. Didn't have a phone or computer all day, and then returned home to find out about Instagram's billion dollar acquisition wwhhaatt. Went and got Crispy Duck! with Aaron.

Tuesday, worked on coding the front-end for Pool. Louis figured out a design he likes that's super austere, so I started implementing it and it actually looks awesome on iPhones and iPads. My first time doing a site "mobile-first" and I'm really happy with how easy that approach makes certain design decisions. The complexities of a layout can grow out of its simplest possible instantiation, rather than being compacted if working the opposite way.

Tried writing my essay on the projector at home. Sort of as a joke. Didn't get anything done.

Went to photo. We always start to have interesting discussions about photography as a medium and all the problems. Christine always wants to talk about archives. But people don't seem to really be pursuing those ideas in their work agressively enough to excite me. Most of the stuff we look at is just boring, the biggest problem being: would I even stop to look at this? Maybe that's stupid. Half the class is also extremely quiet, so the dynamic feels off between me, a few other loud people, and the mum half. In talking about work it's usually a very nod and smile kind of conversation, which really makes me antsy.

Walked to Economy Candy with Aaron and bought sour straws and chocolate instead of writing my essay. Censorship was boringinteresting. We watched Godzilla's American and Japanese versions. I made this amazing sling out of my sweater and slept through most of that. Exhaustion, boredom, sugar crash.

Had a wild conversation on Twitter with a bunch of people about Pinboard, Findings, Reading and Readmill. Love the brains of that bunch. Allen [Storified it nicely](http://storify.com/tealtan/pinboard-technique). And Henrik from Readmill wants to meet up in June and talk, which is exciting.

Max uses DMs like IMs, which I've never done with anyone else. But we had a really exciting conversation about futures. Felt less scared about my (lack of) summer plans after talking to him.

Spent Wednesday bouncing between trying to write the Censorship essay, procrastinating, and reading about desconstruction for Pub Design. Deconstruction sort of makes me eyes glaze over, even though it's exciting in a boringinteresting way.

Had a really [good exchange with @litherland about criticism](http://storify.com/caseyg/criticism). She pointed me to [this article by Cary Wood](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/puttingourhotheadstogether/) that I wish was written less specifically about web design because it so applies to everything. Was thinking both about my frustrations with the quiet class that would rather nod and smile than stir up trouble. But also about how social networks enforce a kind of positive "Like" and "+1" but also just the idea of networking, which makes it hard to be critical towards sensitive people. Anyway, that article zapped a frantic feeling I didn't know I was having. Grateful for that.

Publication design was good. I am so, so surprised that I am finding it to be my favorite class this semester. I have never really liked a design class, but Warren is tough, smart, and funny. Had a good discussion about DeconstructionNnNN. Then talked about our ideas for the final project. I'm giving mine the tentative title of "Workflow." In a broader scope than the magazine, which inevstigates software design, this is about machines and systems people invent to adapt to the world. Some examples: Ted Nelson inventing hypertext for his hummingbird mind, Temple Grandin calming herself down with a cow squeezer. Those are famous examples, but everyone has their own things that they do. Still need to work on understanding what these interests are about and how they fit together.

Finished my candy. Tried to stay up late and write my essay but…fell asleep.

Today worked on my Censorship essay while in Western Theories. Otherwise zoned out or worked on giving myself water poisoning to escape to the bathroom and not have to deal with such a dangerously boring conversation. I like Weinstein, which is the weird part, but can't stomach the class at all. I think the one time he called one me I was like: I hate all these theorists. All of them. Not going to talk about Rosalind Krauss. And he kind of moved on. I feel bad that I don't feel bad about being so inattentive, but my attention span was wickedly short today and it feels dangerous to know this stuff too well. It trips my bullshit detector. I'd learn it at a different time in a different place, but can't do it now. Hoping I can pass it, at this point. Ate noodles with Aaron then ran back to Brooklyn to walk Sneezeburg. Worked on this weeknote and then zipped back to school for sculpture. Sculpture was good but, again, no focus today. Was basically on my phone for one entire crit and then climbing up the walls for the next. I feel like an asshole, as Aaron pointed out, I was being one. I would hate having myself in class a lot of the time. That criticism discussion also reminds me of ways that I want to be a better classmate.
