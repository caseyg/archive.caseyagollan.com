title: Week 3

Had lots of fun this week(!) but it was lousy work-wise. A getting-sick mixed with spring-fever-y lull to last week's mania.

Thursday I was tired and in a weird mood from staying up all night. Didn't really manage to read Kant or Hegel so that was a painful Western Theories of Art class discussion. Sculpture was okay, flapped my gums without saying anything smart about the work. 

Audrey linked me to this great essay by [Joe Scanlan on social space and relational aesthetics](https://www.readability.com/articles/vzosabhm).

&gt; Relational aesthetics set out to tap the creative potential of social space. But now--more than ever--social space is responsible for suppressing most of what is worthwhile about making art in the first place: Narcissism. Solipsism. Delusion. Perversion. Dedication. Fantasy. Absurdity. And while relational aesthetics might have changed the kinds of conversations we have about art, to include questions such as what an artwork might be made of, who could be involved, or where it might begin and end, rarely have these ideas been acute enough in practice to overcome common decency. And that's a shame. Because if there's one thing we need less of in the United States right now, it's common decency--or at least Bill Frist's idea of common decency. These days, both politically and aesthetically, I prefer to adhere to Martin Kippenberger's creed: "Keiner hilft keinem." Every man for himself. For better and worse, Kippy's iconoclasm affords a greater range of expression than tacit collaboration ever could. What's more, it just feels better. For all relational aesthetics' claims to utopia and tomorrow being another fine day, an aesthetic that can't allow anything bad to happen sounds more like anesthesia to me.

But I sort of lost steam on whatever I was mad about last week regarding social practice and [that-kaila-show](http://www.workmakeswork.org). 

Friday went to Chelsea for the first time in maybe a year. Aaron picked up a [Pwr Paper](http://pwrpaper.com/) at Printed Matter then we went to wait in line for [Doug Wheeler](http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibition/doug-wheeler/). Spent maybe 45 minutes waiting outside the gallery. It was cold. Aaron had to leave for class before we even got in (ha), but I sat there and sat there and sat there. The two sort of old ladies in front of me were funny because one was really calm and the other one kept saying things like, "if I wanted to see a blank room I could just go into my bathroom!" After getting inside there was another hour of waiting but I finished The Handmaid's Tale, which I had to read for school that weekend anyway. The waiting room scene was as much of a spectacle as the thing itself. A group of school kids who waited more patiently than I would've been able to at that age. Listening to the gallerina repeat instructions to everyone. She asked the kids not to run up the curved wall. Some of the kids came out like OMG and others were like WASTE OF TIME. I stayed in for just over a full cycle, taking my glasses off and putting them on, walking around and standing still, noticing dust or flaws in the paint and spacing out, trying to remember if my eyes were open or closed. It was pretty similar to seeing this [Olafur piece at SF MOMA](http://www.olafureliasson.net/works/360_room_for_all_colours.html) a few years ago. The weirdest part was that I couldn't stop thinking about how much I wanted to clip my eyelashes. They were causing vignetting!

Walked back to school and then met Niki in Chinatown for porkbuns, bubble tea, and Xi'an, but I was too exhausted (maybe from having my eyes/brain blasted with light) and made for bad company. Went to a fun party later.

Saturday did nothing but take a walk and make the best ravioli ever, which we bought from some ludicrously authentic smoky garage.

Saw a wheelchair dog!

Saw the Rite Aid in Greenpoint that used to be some kind of roller disco and still has a disco ball! (Highly recommended.)

Sunday did the superbowl thing and that was fun. Not sure why the ads were so bad this year or how they turned the entire field into a screen in 10 minutes but it looked awesome. Especially when they dropped Madonna in a hole and flashed this message out of nowhere:

Sunday was also my one year anniversary of following myself-a-year-ago on various social networks (weird!) thanks to [twitshift](http://www.twitshift.com/) and more recently [timehop](http://timehop.com/). It's always crazy seeing what was going on a year ago. And I love rediscovering old gems like this:

Monday I bought a giant pad of newsprint and screwed it into the wall of my studio, but have yet to write on it. Sort of like buying a too-nice notebook. Filed under: failed motivational techniques. Rejiggered the Girl Walk [events page](http://girlwalkallday.com/events) for them before they head out to the west coast. Still some work to do on that site. Had a good burrito.

Tuesday had five minutes of photo because Christine was doing studio visits for the next two days. Censorship was good, although I felt the pain of having to repeat a lower-level class when sitting through a lesson on how to use academic databases and cite your sources. Sort of blacked out on my desk and the librarian lecturing us publicly shamed me. Cool. Went home feeling sick, took NyQuil, fell asleep.

The highlight of a rather slooow and braindead week was a studio visit with Christine on Wednesday. She showed up with readings and questions based on the introduce-yourselves-survey we had taken on the first day. It's exciting to take such a structure-less class where the teacher's only agenda is to help you move your work forward. Words I scribbled down in my notebook: whimsy, (dark) humor, telling a joke until it's no longer funny, people who hang on to youth culture until they're 70, discomfort, photo archive, if I went blind, the problem is the content.

Other than that spent all of Wednesday doing my Publication Design homework that I didn't get around to doing. Mad at myself for waiting until the day it was due to start. That shouldn't happen. That class makes me feel REALLY BAD at design, in a good way. It feels a lot like having a graphic design job (which is annoying) but I can tell I'm getting better faster than I was at work. He's a great teacher.

We had to read + respond to Jeff Keedy's _The Rules of Typography According to <strike>Crackpots</strike> Experts_ in which he quotes Beatrice Warde's famous crystal goblet:

&gt; Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than to hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain... Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a “modernist” in the sense in which I am going to use the term. That is, the first thing he asked of this particular object was not “How should it look?” but “What must it do?” and to that extent all good typography is modernist.

But then Keedy is all like, "Beatrice Warde did not imagine her crystal goblet would contain PEPSI-COLA, but some vessel has to do it." It's a liberating read, sticking it to stodgy old typographers. His golden rule is: pay attention. (The opposite of following or reacting to rules.) For the illustration portion of my response I photographed this horrendously cheesy goblet of alphabet soup.

I have a hard time getting excited and feeling good about graphic design. I pretty much always want to be like I DIDN'T MAKE THAT. There's a better way, which I need to figure out, that's not just getting it done.

This morning I gave a nervous little presentation on Riegel's history of ornament and we talked about that and Wolflinn. It was better than last week but by the end I was still writhing in my seat with spring fever!!!! Went outside for a long time and stretched and climbed on the building like a maniac until a security guard came outside and was like STOP. It was really fun. Sculpture was just-okay. Had a funny conversation about a boring piece. Tried to remember other times where we had good conversations about bad work, it's possible but today sucked.

If I had my way I would just play outside all day. Christine joked that people think of art school as this place where people are drugged out and painting with tempera but it's really rigorous and hard. Tons of self-motivation required. Spartan work ethics! Which most of the time is hard to pull off. I have a bunch of Writer windows open on my computer of things that need to get written, sent, done. Hoping for a few quiet, productive days. And not getting sicker. Going to manage my huge amounts of time better and stop waiting for the mood to strike to do work. In conclusion: ice cream, NyQuil, goodnight.
