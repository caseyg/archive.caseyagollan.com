content: It is made entirely out of salvaged materials. The structure is 3 bamboo poles I found behind a shed and the walls are made of tyvek and plastic bags zip-tied and stapled together. The walls acted like sails and caught enough wind to bring the teepee to the ground almost every night, but the resilient bamboo and plastic structure rarely needed mending. At the center of the structure hung a plum bob pendulum, but I planned to replace it with a chandelier. One night we projected a film about bees backwards onto a wall of the teepee and lay inside watching it. Looking back, it was definitely a precursor to my <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/2007/final-project">Oxbow Final Project</a>.
