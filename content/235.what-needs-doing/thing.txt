Hi again, friends and friends-of-friendsâ€”

What needs doing? I'm available to take on new work, now that two of my jobs are finished, two are being polished off, and two have turned into ongoing commitments that are small and sporadic.

I like weird jobs and good people. I'm down with remote work. Nothing is too small to propose. Some things I [can do](/for-hire) are: write and edit; organize, administrate, and strategize; design and build websites; make videos and photographs; and move your boxes.


If you think I could help you OR you know somebody that I should talk to OR you just want to say hi:

I also wrote a little bit below about the kinds of work I've been doing in the past nine months.

Thanks for reading, and please feel free to pass this along.

Nine months ago I wrote [an open cover letter](/for-hire) asking the internet for work.

After putting out the letter I received 14 leads. Four-teen!

Six of these never went beyond an initial email or three. Or we planned to get coffee or something and never did.

Nine went on to real life interviews or proposals. I talked to: an artist, the producers of a social media awards ceremony, a hedge fund startup, a poet, two schools, an editor, a gallerist, and a web design shop.

I ended up taking on six projects:

<ol>
<li data-okimage="@path/zach.jpg"><span>Doing research with <a href="http://twitter.com/zachlieberman">Zach Lieberman</a> for <a href="http://vimeo.com/69437363">his talk at Eyeo</a> on education, and organizing some materials for a workshop he did in Japan</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/bhqfu.jpg"><span>A four-month fellowship at <a href="http://bhqfu.org">BHQFU</a>, where I was <a href="https://education.hackpad.com/">teaching</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/freecooperunion">organizing</a> around free education with <a href="http://twitter.com/victoriasobel">Victoria</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pleasedontfront">Joe</a>. We were often working there so late that we just slept there.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/tom.png"><span>Building <a href="http://www.tomhealy.net">a fun and reader-friendly website</a> for a poet named <a href="http://twitter.com/tphealy">Tom Healy</a>.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/rodi.png"><span>Building <a href="http://rodigallery.com">a map-based website</a> for Rodi Gallery, an art space in a truck.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/sfpc.png"><span>Helping start the artist-run <a href="http://sfpc.io">School for Poetic Computation</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/zachlieberman">Zach</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tchoi8">Taeyoon</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/datatelling">Jen</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/pitaru">Amit</a>, and attempting to model a radically open and generous organization by <a href="http://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration">publishing our finances on Github</a> and returning money we didn't spend to students.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/source.png"><span>Copy-editing articles on journalism and code over at <a href="http://source.opennews.org">Source</a>, mostly with <a href="http://twitter.com/kissane">Erin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kiostark">Kio</a>, but also <a href="http://twitter.com/erika_owens">Erika</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dansinker">Dan</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanpitts">Ryan</a>.</span></li>
</ol>

I tracked 366.05 work hours (though I underreported since I was mostly tracking hours to help myself understand my work patterns), and netted $19,541.66. That _seems_ to me like a lot of money to have made from scuttling around doing things that I like, but I'm still broke because&hellip;New York.

There were also lots of non-work-related things that happened in the past nine months:

<ul>
<li data-okimage="@path/collonade.JPG"><span>Had my senior show at Cooper Union. Mostly a big diff, analyzing how the Board's governance has changed since 1859. (Going to get that documentation onlineâ€¦someday.)</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/empty.jpg"><span>Didn't graduate. Not on purpose but not by accident. Ask me about my degree only if you want to get sucked into an hour-long rant on the changing nature of credentials and higher education.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/dna.png"><span>Put <a href="http://github.com/caseyg/dna">my genome on Github</a>. Fork me!</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/occupation.jpg"><span>Occupied the President's Office at Cooper for 65 days.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/stigmergy.jpg"><span>Spent two weeks in the woods with the Finnish side of my family. There is an hour of my life that I will never forget where I stared at an ant hill and thought about stigmergy.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/nspc.jpg"><span>Spent a few days at the <a href="http://studentpower2013.org">National Student Power Convergence</a> in Wisconsin learning and meeting student organizers.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="@path/politicsofdestruction.jpg"><span>Set off the smoke alarm at e-flux during <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/96010/the-politics-of-parody-free-cooper-union-at-e-flux/">a dramatic reading</a> of a leaked Cooper Board meeting.</span></li>
</ul>

I attempted to write about this ALL before realizing that I could spend more time writing about the past months than it took to live them. Aren't you glad this wasn't 15,000 words? Instead, let's get together and talk!

Hope to work together,

Casey
