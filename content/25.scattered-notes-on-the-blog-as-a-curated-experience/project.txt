title: Scattered Notes on the Blog as a Curated Experience

excerpt: Blogs are a lame format for how we have come to use and peruse them. Someday I want to be the curator for an interesting blogger. Their job would be new acquisitions, which are vital, but the front page would be weekly rotating connections between archived content.

<p>Blog sounds like BLAH for a reason. I don&#8217;t want to mince words, simply put: blogs are a <strong>lame</strong> format for how we have come to use and peruse them.</p>

<p>When you walk into a museum, you don&#8217;t see every single acquisition starting the most recent and going backwards through a long hallway.</p>

<p>Why is the entire internet reverse chronological? Why is every bit of content encapsulated?</p>

<p>The internet is a mess. There&#8217;s too much to read, scan, even sort. (see: <a href="http://slowweb.tumblr.com">slow web</a>) Search is useless when I don&#8217;t know what I want to find.</p>

<p>Where have all the connections gone?</p>

<p>Certain bloggers, like <a href="http://kottke.org">Kottke</a>, curate through cadence: short titles, primarily text, short description, short excerpts. Or <a href="http://thingsmagazine.net">Things</a>, lots of mysteriously and loosely related links and short tangents.</p>

<p>Someday I want to be the curator for an interesting blogger. Their job would be new acquisitions, which are vital, but the front page would be weekly rotating connections between archived content.</p>

<p>I am still chewing on <a href="http://criticalterrain.wordpress.com">Alan Rapp</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.heyhotshot.com/blog/2009/08/20/self-publishing-interview-with-alan-rapp/index.html">response</a> on how having an editor AND and an author defies the auteur model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For all the possible flaws in the trade publishing model, one thing I always liked about it is the collaborative process. It defies the auteur model; the author is almost never the sole creator. I suppose that this could sound like the ex-editor making a case for the value of his role in an industry that is really undergoing massive and fundamental changes, but I stand by the principle: all content benefits from editing. The author <em>[or is it the collector in this scenario?],</em> whether a verbal or visual one, is almost always too involved with the material to see how it can be best adapted to another form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And returning to the <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/some_thoughts_on_the_anthology/">A Working Library post on anthologies</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the novel is the vinyl record, the anthology is the mixtape—it defies escape into any particular work in exchange for seeing the whole of something bigger. The meaning is in the collection—in the composition of distractions—not in any kind of singular reading experience.
  …
  Here, also, is an image of a book that I would like to hold: that of a collection of readings that are loved, that are gathered up for reasons personal and so peculiar, that when joined become a book—not because of the paper or the binding or the barcode, but because of the pleasure they impart—because, for a time, in this one person’s mind, they belong together. Such a book need never be printed to exist. It need only be shared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wordpress/Movable Type are the ultimate writing CMS&#8217;s, Tumblr is the ultimate collecting CMS, how are we to curate?</p>

<p>Each approach and presentation must be so unique that it almost defies the possibility of having its content managed.</p>

<p>All this comes to mind as I am learning and wrestling in both my <a href="http://prcss.com">personal projects</a> and <a href="http://20x200.com">internship</a> with how the web <em>should</em> work.</p>
