<p>Alex, Aaron, and I made a site that puts YouTube videos on sweaters. But it might also be the next level / logical conclusion / death of the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sexy-sweaters">Sexy Sweaters meme</a> (which Alex is credited as originating(!) on Know Your Meme).</p>
<p>Wrangled APIs from YouTube, Clicky, Bitly to pull the whole site off with no database. And went a little cuckoo on the interface: it's completely chromeless until you hover, then a radial menu is triggered with links to the most popular sweaters in the past few days, a form field to generate your own, and a link to the psychotic <a href="http://sweatytube.com/activity">activity dashboard</a> (worth a look if you like seizure-inducing hovers).</p>
