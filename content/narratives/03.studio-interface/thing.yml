title: Is My Studio an Interface?

author: Casey Gollan

content: 
Last year a Freshman approached me and told me that they decided to hand in “nothing” in response to a prompt that one of their foundation professors gave them. Somebody in their class told them: you should go talk to Casey Gollan, he does nothing too.

I can’t believe this is my legacy. But it’s true. Two years ago I made the following proposition: 

> I’ve tried and tried but I see no way to arrive at a sculpture...Do we need to critique the merits of an object? Can we have a conversation with no center- piece?...I’ve had richer experiences reading books than looking at art first-hand...I want to be proud of a stream of thought, or a few hours spent on the Internet like a model knows...”I look good”...but here, if you live and work in your head, you have to prove yourself to others...if you don’t subscribe to the idea that “making is thinking” you must expend extra energy—a lot of extra energy—into showing your work, because you cannot just present your turds...I am asking this room to not produce...I am begging that we waste no more cycles discussing the merits of ar- tifacts because we are sophisticated enough, I should hope, to not require props...Deport artists who want to labor like farmhands to the farms...I do not wish to make a sculpture now or ever.

It is true that I have problems focusing and I have problems with authority (meaning if you ask me to do something I can’t help but do the opposite even when I see myself reacting in this way and observe that it’s pretty stupid). Both of these things could be said to get in the way of “making work”, and most of the time I can’t tell which one it is. 

I also like inflicting mind games upon myself, so instead of cultivating some unique research interest or getting in touch with materials, when I was still an innocent freshmen, I bought a now- yellowing copy of a book called Art School: Propositions for the 21st Century. According to an essay in the book, the Greek term from which we derive the English word school means “’a pursuit or time of leisure’ (taken from a withholding of, or vacation from, other kinds of more instrumentalized time)”. 

I have seen few places less leisurely than Cooper Union.

When I read this quote as a sophomore I think I got confused about what school was supposed to be a vacation from, and turned it in on itself. School, I supposed, should be a vacation from being a student and an artist as those roles were understood￼by me at the time.

It’s not that I hate working and just want to lie
around all day, it’s just that I looked around at what my peers were doing and I couldn’t get into it. And when I tried to make things, I also couldn’t get into it. But love ideas. I like reading and writing. I like to take my time. However, I felt marginalized by a structure that told me “making is thinking”, and the more you make, the more you think. 

I have problems with ideas too. There are terrors in the back of my mind: I don’t want to be a podcast! (Sproing!) I don’t want to give a TED Talk. (Now that is an idea worth sharing!) But above all I don’t want to make a sculpture.

So I rolled out a mattress on top of two desks, made my bed, and decided, essentially, to sleep through Sophomore year. This was awesome mostly as a juxtaposition with my next door neighbor Rachael, who worked like Sisyphus: gluing little lithographed squares onto large sheets of paper from morning ‘til night every day, her large prints always creeping closer into my intentionally empty space.

In the studio I was given my Junior year, I built a padded bench that was both less obnoxious than a bed and more comfortable. I slept there often, and also read and worked. Others appreciated it too, this time, probably because I didn’t force my sculpture class to critique it. But I still didn’t know what to do with the rest of my studio. The materials I started acquiring were strangely like those of a gym: a yoga ball, a trampoline, and some hula hoops. When I had too much energy I would jump on the trampoline and get sufficiently tired, with the yoga ball I strengthened my core, and I realized that if I tried to read while hula hooping, by trying not to drop the hoop I could stay in one place for longer than usual without getting distracted. 

The books I read while hula hooping tended to be about computers as spaces in which we work and play. But concepts of the interface in computing also apply to the physical realm. “A book is an interface,” writes Johanna Drucker, “so is a newspaper page, a bathroom faucet, a car dashboard, and an ATM machine. An interface is not so much a “between” space as it is the mediating environment that makes the experience...a full theory of interface goes beyond the design of information structures and tasks into the realization that these are only the armature, not the essence of the space of provocation in which the performative event takes place.”

This is a little heady. But there are different levels at which I can theorize this: basically, I have a new studio now and it doesn’t yet offer a good place to sleep. My proposition is to make studio furniture. I’ve been doing this in some capacity since I snarkily rolled out my mattress Sophomore year. In a way, to propose a piece of furniture to a sculpture class is a sad day for me. I feel that I am acquiescing. Reneging on the promise young-me made to now- me, to not “put out”, artistically speaking—without first giving everyone hell. 

In time, I’ve relaxed my hatred towards all forms of art and my desire to control the way everyone around me is working. I’ve also come to see my struggle with making art, and how much fun I have showing people nothing and watching them get mad, as not just the worst-ever case of procrastination or hesitation or insecurity or leisure, but a long and hard look at the theoretical and environmental design of the art school and the artist’s studio. 

So the terms are that this is an installation, because it relates entirely to this site. What can I make of the studio: a space for work and play, when conceived of as a physical interface. I’m curious about how a desk emanates an idea about learning that is totally different from a bed, or a couch and a trampoline. And I’m interested in this in relation to the history of the school, about which I’ve heard everything from Bauhaus and Bozart to Meritocracy to Making is Thinking. Leisure is still what resonates most with me, but I want to scrutinize all these claims. And set this up as an opportunity to think more carefully, play more, and relax harder.
