In a series of videos I was working on last year, I had begun to collect thoughts on direct human-computer interfaces and linked data / the semantic web.

Over the summer I wrote a long essay about interfaces and technodeterminism: where they come from, what they mean today, and where we might taken them.

The example I had thrown out at the end of the essay was a workstation designed like a solar system. Instead of files and folders, dreary bits of office culture that had been skeuomorphically etched into every major operating system, I teased at a workstation that would bring objects in and out of orbits, passing by on intervals. While it hardly sounds practical or usable (I had made fun of such an interface in [an earlier blog post](http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/5151672211/mixing-metaphors-skeuomorphic-hyper-and-fantasy) I had come to crave a more opinionated interface.

This idea of a "more opinionated interface," was something I had been grappling with in school, too, turning my entire allotted studio space into a makeshift bed and shitting on boring yet exhibitionist traditional studio practices in a series of "sexy" (or silly) self-portraits taken in others' studio spaces.

It was (and is) hard to draw the line between mockery, bullying, fumbling, and figuring things out. But I always had a sense of what bothered me. Especially in the sensitivephotogeneration.com website, which crudely allowed users to drag and drop cliched elements from "sensitive' photographs into a new composition. One person asked why I would spend $10 on a domain to make fun of his work.

In a class about social practice art, I literally ran out the door and as far south as I could when it was my turn to present, ending up at a chain-link fence at the southern tip of Manhattan.
