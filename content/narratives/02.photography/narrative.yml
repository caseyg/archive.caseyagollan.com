Great grandma on mom's side who thought photography was a sin.

Granny on dad's side who was a photographer for the New York Times. Grandpa wrote the articles, sometimes granny was paid more for her images than his words.

Photo, on Tuesday, was great. We talked about a reading on ruins that reminded me of these [1, 2, 3]. Everybody showed old things and talked about where they’re coming from / at / going. Starting with my psychotic breakdown last time I took a photo class:

Dawit wasn’t interested in ideas. Only pretty projects. And I was thinking big and scary.

Then decided to go after sensitive photographers, many of whom are friends. It wasn’t the things in books that angered me, it was the people around me.

Took the sexy studio art portraits, resulting in a D and an admonishment to be compassionate, constructive, and ethical:

Decent advice but that group needed to be shaken up much more than I was able to.
Told a story about the two sides of my family. On my dad’s side and back a few generations they were prolific recreational photographers. I found a box of beautiful glass negatives at granny & grandpas.
Family (dad’s side) with guns:

One night at dinner my mom was telling me about her grandmother with long silver hair and bright blue eyes. I said I had never seen a picture of her. That’s because, I learned, she considered photography to be a SIN. A SIN! So she was never photographed. I was overjoyed when I heard that. It made sense in some weird hereditary-we-take-issue-with-this way. ME. TOO. GRANNY.

Anyway, the stories are fun, but most people are more interesting than their work, said Christine. The goal, I think, this time around — going forward — is to do something with all these problems that isn’t so much of a direct reaction or disparaging to a certain group. Even if I’m saying the same thing essentially, Dawit’s little trio of advice still makes me wrinkle my nose because it’s about being nice in all the wrong (fake!) ways.
