title: For Hire
-
excerpt:

Hi friends,

This May I'm graduating from Cooper Union and entering the <del>void</del> world...which means I'm looking for work as soon as possible.

I'm busy applying for jobs in the fields of design, open government, and regular-'ol-day-jobs, _but_ I have a weird hunch (and hope) that my next move could be doing something with somebody who I already know and admire. If you're reading this, maybe that's you?
