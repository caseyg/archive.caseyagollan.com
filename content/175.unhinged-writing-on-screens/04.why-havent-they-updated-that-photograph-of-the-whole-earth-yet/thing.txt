title: Why haven't they updated that photograph of the whole Earth yet?

I installed [Satellite Eyes](http://satelliteeyes.tomtaylor.co.uk) a month ago. It's a quiet little program by [Tom Taylor](http://scraplab.net) that sets your desktop to a satellite view of where you're computing from whenever you open your laptop. 

[The source](https://github.com/tomtaylor/satellite-eyes) was released on Github today! I thought about adding a feature that would allow your Satellite Eyes to save a trail of your maps as you move about. Then I realized that it already does this, incidentally, by keeping a cache. I dug through my cache (<code>~/Library/Application Support/Satellite Eyes/</code>) and found that I've connected in five unique places since installing it. 

Granny and Grandpa's.

Mom's.

I've walked under that highway over and over again but never really pictured its shape. When I first saw this as my background it took me five minutes to figure out what that highway even _was_.  

Dad's.

Or at least I think this is Dad's. It looks like Manhattan, where the internet pipes come up in [strange places](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Hudson_Street).

Inka's. (Helsinki!)

Tiina's. ([Suurpelto](http://suurpelto.fi/en/home.html))

Suurpelto translates literally to "large field." Which makes sense if you look at this photo. But it's actually a futuristic housing development which, from my window, looks more like a construction site than a field. 

Since you can't see it from space or street view yet I can describe it to you a little.

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/47460788?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;loop=1" width="500" height="900" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

Since I shot this video, they've already put a fence up around that whole site in preparation for whatever comes next.

I actually don't know how to react to an optimistic development. 

In New York it seems like when you're building a big planned something it always comes at the expense of old somethings. It feels profane to overwrite New York's chaotic emergence with any singular idea about architecture that wants to run too wide. (Tall is okay.) It's the real life version of [that website where everyone can draw together but you're only allowed to color in one pixel at a time](http://themaninblue.com/experiment/Pixelfest/). New York is even a grid. But people can't be bothered, in  New York, to collectively make pretty pictures, which some people might huff at but that's what I like best about it.

According the _The Atlantic_, as an American you have the undo some deeply ingrained Truths to understand how things work in Finland. I read [an article about the school system here](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/12/what-americans-keep-ignoring-about-finlands-school-success/250564/) that said, "while Americans love to talk about competition...nothing makes Finns more uncomfortable. In his book Sahlberg quotes a line from Finnish writer named Samuli Paronen: &lsquo;Real winners do not compete.&rsquo; It's hard to think of a more un-American idea, but when it comes to education, Finland's success shows that the Finnish attitude might have merits." Anyway, because Finland is [86% forests](http://www.forest.fi/smyforest/foresteng.nsf/0/BE3C5576C911F822C2256F3100418AFD?Opendocument) (and, as the joke goes, 14% lakes! _Also not sure what to think about a joke with a percentage point for a punchline._) they have more to gain than lose by building big new developments. 

So here on the large field they are drawing in swoops.

There will be no garbage trucks! Because they laid underground tubes before starting the houses. On the hour, from beneath the earth, comes the pneumatic whir of trash, compost, and recycling being sucked someplace far away, allegedly at 70 miles per hour.

There isn't a store yet. Maybe next year, in the middle of this photo.

A school will follow, if everything goes as planned.

Today a Finnish cover band played at a block party for residents. The creator of Angry Birds (which is equal parts [sooo over](http://www.treysmithblog.com/the-fall-of-angry-birds/) and sooo Finnish, and which I previously had no opinion about but now decided I unconditionally love) was on hand to say a few words in Finnish (which I don't speak anymore) and cut the ribbon at a new Angry Birds playground for children.

Construction crews have descended and rows of buildings have been raised and block parties have been held and work continues from morning 'til night in the slow blink of the Satellite's Eye, so that Large Fieldâ„¢ still appears to be an actual large field. And I can't locate myself in the picture, not because I'm inept at reading these images, but because the satellite hasn't yet picked it up yet? You can build a city without getting caught?! Even if you catch it you won't understand it??
