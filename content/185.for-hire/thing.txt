Hello friends and friends of friends,

This May I'm graduating from Cooper Union and entering the <del>void</del> world...which means I'm looking for work as soon as possible.

I have a weird hunch (or maybe just a _hope_) that — because the internet is a weird place — my next move _could_ be getting paid to do something with somebody who I [**already** know](http://twitter.com/caseyg/following) and admire.

If you're reading this, maybe that's you?

You can reach me by email at [hello@caseyagollan.com](mailto:hello@caseyagollan.com) or by phone at 914.471.0959.

_Or_ keep scrolling for a little bit more about things I can do (making websites, writing and editing, social media, video and photography, organizing and strategizing, and moving your boxes), things I want to learn, and how much money I need to make to keep living in New York.

## Making websites

![](http://caseyagollan.com/content/140.girl-walk-all-day-website/girlwalk-01.png)

### [Girl Walk // All Day](http://girlwalkallday.com)

When my friends <a href="http://wildcombination.com">Jacob and Youngna</a> blew through the funding target for their [Kickstarter-funded](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/720656387/girl-walk-all-day)-music-video-epic _Girl Walk // All Day_ they decided to take their movie on a worldwide tour. Working off of the graphic design stylings of [Kelli Anderson](http://kellianderson.com), and with the back end programming help of [David Yee](http://tangentialism.com), we launched a fairly complex website in a matter of weeks. Youngna wrote about some of her favorite parts of the site [on her blog](http://blog.youngnapark.com/2011/10/girl-walk-all-day-redesign-trailer.html). Because the movie is all about dancing across New York City _and_ was slated to premiere at [Brooklyn Beta](https://brooklynbeta.org/), I pushed for making the site completely responsive. I was happy to see that the [audience approved](https://twitter.com/RWD/status/125587985449234433).

### [CooperUnion.biz](http://cooperunion.biz)

One December evening my roommates [Aaron](http://aaron-graham.com), [Alex](http://g-i-b-s-o-n.com), and I threw together this parody site skewering the corporatization of our alma-mater. (Part of ongoing work about [Free-ing Cooper Union](http://facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion).) It has since been shared by the likes of [The Yes Men](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151421401446616&id=96761506615), [Huffington Post](https://twitter.com/HuffPostArts/status/334376608188203008), and [Art in America](https://twitter.com/AiANews/status/334415141179363329); written up on [Fast Company's Co.Exist blog](http://fastcoexist.com/1682073/tricky-activists-protest-the-corporatization-of-education-with-a-brilliant-fake-site); and made the rounds in classrooms at NYU and the New School. I like doing things like this: funny, fast, effective.

### 20x200

I started interning for [Jen Bekman](http://twitter.com/jenbee) right out of high school, and within a couple of months was hired (to my disbelief) as a half-time in-house designer. I worked there for two years, designing and shipping production quality HTML/CSS for large portions of the site, as well as making countless experiments and prototypes. I learned about the ins-and-outs of startup e-commerce like test-driven design, iterative development, and collecting a ton of metrics to optimize everything. The dream team that Jen put together, many of whom I consider to be mentors, have gone on to create things like Girl Walk, <a href="http://editorially.com">Editorially</a>, and <a href="http://tinybop.com">Tinybop</a>.

## Writing and editing

![](http://caseyagollan.com/content/155.book-review-programmed-visions/book-review-programmed-visions.png)

### Book review

[Joanne McNeil](http://joannemcneil.com), former editor of [_Rhizome_](http://rhizome.org) (and one of my all-time [favorite bloggers](http://internet-of-dreams.com)), handed me a copy of Wendy Hui Kyong Chun's [_Programmed Visions_](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jan/23/book-review-programmed-visions-software-and-memory) which I reviewed for the site.

### Essay

I wrote [User-Generated Content](http://pooool.info/user-generated-content), a lengthy musing on artists, social networks, interface design, and institutional critique, for [_Pool_](http://pooool.info) (which editor [Louis Doulas](http://louisdoulas.info) later approached me to [redesign](http://caseyagollan.com/pool/)).

### Blogging

When I worked at Jen Bekman I wrote over [250 blog posts](http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/966905918/writing-on-hey-hot-shot) on the artists we worked with.

## Social media

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Student activists take note. @<a href="https://twitter.com/freecooperunion">freecooperunion</a> is giving a master class in how to use Twitter as an activist tool.</p>&mdash; Angus Johnston (@studentactivism) <a href="https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/326789400849707008">April 23, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There's a lot of crazytalk out there about juicing up one's social media presence for profit and fame, but I personally subscribe to the idea that if you just _be human_ good things will follow. While I was responsible for social media at Jen Bekman our little community was generally happy and thriving. I was the human behind our Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr accounts, and I launched our Tumblr. I drafted a several page internal guide including a rundown of my workflows and tools-of-the-trade as well as best practices regarding pacing, replies, and tone. This is the kind of thing that's just second-nature for me, maybe because I grew up on computers and can never stop looking at my phone.

Now, alongside [Joe](http://pleasedontfront.tumblr.com), I'm at the helm of Free Cooper Union on <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Angus Johnston, a [historian of student activism](http://studentactivism.net) at CUNY, recently [called us](https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/326789400849707008) a "master class in how to use Twitter as an activist tool." Only, soon we might not be the underdog anymore, seeing as how we've [surpassed the official Cooper Union page](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=469887223092101&set=a.392421814171976.58168719.391957684218389&type=1) in popularity. Oops.

## Making videos and photographing

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qhowml0sBBI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a little embarrassing _but_ I wrote, recorded, shot, starred in, and edited this music video intending to seduce financial transparency out of Cooper Union's administrators. A kind of oblique open government initiative. The _New York Times_, covering student protests, acknowledged me as a "[terrible but amusing rapper](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/nyregion/cooper-unions-tradition-of-free-tuition-may-be-near-end.html?pagewanted=all#p[DltAwt])."

But that's besides the point, which is that I can help _you_ make videos.

## Organizing and Strategizing

![](http://caseyagollan.com/content/160.systems/systems-01.png)

Last March I published a kind of [screed on _systems_](http://caseyagollan.com/systems/read). I'm hungry to do more systems thinking along the lines of Donella Meadows' [_Leverage Points_](http://www.sustainer.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf), John Gall's [_Systemantics_](http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~fasiha/systemantics/), James C. Scott's [_Seeing Like a State_](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300078152), and O'Reilly's [_Open Government_](https://github.com/oreillymedia/open_government) anthology — though I'm not sure how I could do this as a form of employment (beyond _consulting_ which I lament in the systems essay linked above).

Similarly, my favorite part of the design work I've done has always been the more abstract organizational side rather than the "graphics".

## Moving your boxes or whatever

Liz Danzico's tweet about [mentornship](https://twitter.com/bobulate/status/1280455190) from so long ago has really stuck with me. An irrational fear I have is getting too deep into work that pretends to be meaningful but is actually just stealing three-quarters of my brainspace while ultimately being about serving a revenue target. A lot of startup culture seems this way to me, and it's the kind of thing that makes me want to go off the grid and never use a computer again. That's why, rather than having some comfortable bourgeois job, I'd be happy handling some brilliant person's bullshit if it means getting to learn from and with them.

## What I want to get better at

I want to get better at all the things listed above and I hope that I can do so by working. I'm far from great at any of these things, but competent enough at this point to bounce across disciplines and job titles to get shit done.

Also, I'd really like to get fluent enough at back end coding so that I can whip up a web app every time an idea pops into my head instead of mucking around until I go crazy. If working with you could mean you teaching me more about that, I'm so down.

## Cost of living

I've lived in New York City since coming to school here in 2009, supported generously by a full-scholarship from The Cooper Union, rent money from my parents, and pocket change from various employers and freelance clients.

The table below shows every dollar to pass out of my bank account over three full years in the city, including rent, utilities, and food.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Year</th>
		<th>Spending</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2010</td>
		<td>$21,010.04</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2011</td>
		<td>$27,057.20</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2012</td>
		<td>$24,516.54</td>
	</tr>
</table>

For the immediate future, I'd like to continue living in the same shitty Brooklyn apartment that I've shared with my beloved roommates for the past three years. As you can see — in the interest of transparency — the numbers above (after taxes) are the absolute floor of what I'll need to cobble together to live without putting anything away in savings. I have little desire to exceed these amounts if the work is awesome. Really.

## Thanks, and contact info again

Thanks for reading, and please feel free to pass this open cover letter on to anyone you think sounds like a good fit.

I hope we can work together!
