## WTF Happened at Cooper Union

In June 2009 the _Wall Street Journal_ reported that one college, Cooper Union, had "sidestepped the crisis". How was it that colleges and universities across America, some charging their students as much as $60,000 a year in tuition, seemed to be having a hard time paying their bills, while a college that grants a full-tuition scholarship to every single one of its 1000 students had just erected a shiny new building in Manhattan and was floating on a pool of cash? We may never know, because just over two years later in October 2011 Cooper Union's newly appointed President Jamshed Bharucha announced a very different story to the _New York Times_: the college is broke and has actually been digging itself into debt for several decades. Because of the positive press in recent years, almost nobody in the Cooper community — students, faculty, staff, alumni, friends, and neighbors — had suspected anything notable was even going on until picking up that copy of the _Times_. Bharucha's announcement triggered confusion, anger, and an unraveling of messy administrative narratives. 

Cooper Union has historically relied on two main sources of money to fund the free education it provides: big-time philanthropists and unconventional real estate deals. Back when the college's board consisted of Peter Cooper, Abraham Hewitt, and three of their friends, the trustees would allegedly look at the deficit at the end of each year, divide it by five, and each write a check. If Peter Cooper could meet his namesake's board and administration as they exist today he would probably die all over again out of heartbreak or rage. “There are _how many_ hundreds of administrators suckling on the endowment? They want to charge students for _what_?” In the past several decades, the board has steadily sold off the college's real estate assets to fund increasing, unchecked expenses and fulfill the goals of an expansionist “master plan” (which the trustees admit “were not achieved as anticipated”). In 2006, for example, they deemed it prudent to take out a $175 million dollar loan to build a shiny new building, putting up the college's most famous asset, the land beneath the Chrysler Building, as collateral. With a portion of the building's costs eventually offset by a capital campaign, the gigantic loan _actually_ went towards keeping the school running in its growth pattern long enough for former President Campbell to retire with his bonus payments intact. In the aftermath of mismanagement — bad strategies executed poorly for decades — the college is left with nothing left to sell, a threadbare endowment, a $16 million structural deficit, and an administration that will no longer defend the school's bedrock mission of providing free education based on merit alone.

## The Hybrid Model <br> _or How to Throw 1000 People Under The Bus and Look Good Doing It_

President Bharucha issued a vague mandate that the college must be “reinvented for the 21st century”, but what he was really saying is this, “Altering our scholarship policy will be only as a last resort, but in order to create a sustainable model, it has to be one of the options on the table.” Or in other words while the administration “gets” the value of Cooper Union's full-tuition scholarships for all, they consider it to be _just a feature_, something that is detachable as a “last resort”. Begrudgingly putting aside philosophy for a minute, President Bharucha's reasoning about a sustainable business model _still_ makes no sense, because as David Gersten, a Professor in the School of Architecture, points out:

> It is not that: The Cooper Union holds up free education, but that free education holds up The Cooper Union. It is not that: we can no longer afford to: freely educate, but that we cannot afford to break the promise of Free Education. The largest single financial asset that the Cooper Union currently holds is its promise of free education: TO ALL. The value contained within this promise far exceeds our current endowment as well as the physical properties held by the institution including the land under the Chrysler Building. Our challenge and obligation, our social contract, is to comprehend and make more understandable how to mobilize the resources contained within this promise.

Indeed, providing 1000 educations free of charge in a time when American students have amassed over a trillion dollars in student loans is an extraordinary act to be carrying out at this very moment. And while raising money for this purpose is an unimaginably _complex_ job, it is not very _complicated_. Especially because, as Gersten articulates, the college gains a kind on interest on the money that it theoretically “gives away” by spending it to successfully enact a social mission. President Bharucha's unnervingly boilerplate speeches about working together on a sustainable future serve basically as an admission: he cannot raise the $400 million dollars we need. He will not. _His way_ is that of the bureaucrat: abhorring hard, simple risk and feeding on measured, micro-managed complication. 

Thus, as if to caricature its own distended form, the administration declared an official "Reinvention process”: Two “task forces” of students, alumni, and faculty were formed to _have meetings_ on a regular basis until they could deliver reports on expense reduction and revenue generation. Two consulting firms were hired _indefinitely_ to hang around running the numbers on various revenue generating schemes. Chairman Epstein held a disastrous Q&A Forum in which he confirmed to the furious Cooper community that they have “no recourse” against board decisions and he told a room full of alumni that he considers them a “failed investment” (a quote which still stings despite a later apology). The board hired yet another _consultant_ to answer the question: how can they be a better board. Hm. Faculty were given a timespan of a few _weeks_ to come up with revenue generating programs, and were threatened that if they didn't their respective schools would be shuttered.

By all accounts (except the President's!) the process has been inane, but what is _distressing_ about it is its underlying mentality known as “Responsibility Centered Management”. President Bharucha formally charged the deans of each school with presenting a plan to generate a given amount of revenue per year. The deans in turn passed the task of authoring the form and content of these revenue generating programs to their faculty. Suddenly the Hybrid Model had the whole school spending their nights and weekends drafting specs for a plan that reads like a _joke_: fund a free school by simultaneously operating a _very expensive_ school that does not yet exist. In theory this approach's division of labor ensures that those with the most hands-on knowledge get to contribute to the specifics of planning, but it fails to account for a grave misunderstanding at the root of the charge about the efficacy and conflict of interest of generating revenue from educational programs, while also making the plan politically complicated if not impossible for mid-level administrators and untenured faculty (which is almost everyone) to oppose. In Cooper's case, it also sets back the institution's intellectual pace by distributing the stress and responsibility of revenue generation to faculty who should be focused on teaching students, and deflects blame away from the board for mismanagement by forcefully distributing a pre-determined plan's ownership and authorship. Having the future in one's hands has never, ever been less empowering.

## Same Shit, Different Decade

Even if the Board Chairman and President woke up tomorrow and decided to double-down on the school's promise of free education, have they shown they can handle the money? Sadly, as alumni and adjunct professor Kevin Slavin notes, the answer is no:

> If someone asked you for $10,000 and had a board of people who were going to spend it, and no one was supervising them — no one! — and they were accountable to no one — no one! — and if you asked, can I find out what you guys are even talking about and they said — no! — and you said, can I even talk to you — and they said — no! — would you invest in that? If it were for profit, would you believe that it would be likely to be profitable? And yet, that’s where we are. Can you imagine a company, in a crisis, that would bar the NYT, Reuters, and the Wall Street Journal from the room — from this room! The Great Hall! — and bring it’s chairman to address its shareholders who will only answer prepared questions with a lawyer at his side? What is produced in a spectacle like that? What is consumed? What is exhausted? Transparency is not a promise. It’s not an idea. It’s action.

On the brink of collapse, Cooper's administration has vowed to be “transparent”. This means that they posted some financial documents on the website one time and started holding office hours. These moves are not fundamental enough to demonstrate that transparency has in fact been integrated into the future operations of the institution. When I asked if the administration would keep posting financial documents after the crisis has subsided, Chairman Epstein seemed confused as to why I'd want to keep seeing them. What the administration has been slow to understand is that transparency could be a way of life for this institution, not just lipgloss on the bloated pig of administration. Slavin's speech makes the case that changes to the _mechanics_ of Cooper's administration that make it more trustworthy and communicative are this institution's first step towards recovery and maybe its only real option.

It has been painful to come to terms with the fact that the past decades of mismanagement are water under the bridge; that we can't undo the mistakes we didn't realize were being made behind closed doors. What we _can_ do is put in place systems that foster open, accountable communication and more democratic structures of decision-making. While the problem facing Cooper Union is financial, the solution will be political. The problem right now is that some of the actors have changed but it's the same power structure which got us into this mess that continues to bungle getting us out. This is what designer Dan Hill calls a “non-learning system” (Let's not dwell for _too_ long on the irony that institutions of higher education appear to be some of the slowest learners): 

> There is good failure and bad failure. The former is failure that enables a system to learn, becoming more resilient, more adept. The latter is exhibited within a non-learning system. Are these non-learning systems due to their fundamentally out-of-control characteristics, systems whose complexity has grown beyond our comprehension and capability? Or is it simply that policy is too dislocated from its realisation?

Seeing “bad failure” abound, many have already moved on from _higher education_ as we know it, perhaps including some of our own trustees who have dropped off in the past year. In a recent essay, professor and media theorist Clay Shirky rightly points out that education today is not worth what students are being charged for it, and that the internet might offer alternatives to going into debt for education. Citing a “cost disease” in higher education, he writes, "institution-specific explanations—spoiled students expecting a climbing wall; management self-aggrandizement at the expense of educational mission—hold up less well than the generic observation: colleges need a lot of highly skilled people, people whose wages, benefits, and support costs have risen faster than inflation for the last thirty years." This where Cooper's model shines hope into Shirky's world. He sees higher education being reduced, half as common sense and half as a compromise, to something like interactive recorded lectures. I think technology will create amazing possibilities, and classroom teaching need not be pitted against online courses, we should think of them more like cousins. 

Even if it's tough to make ends meet, the Cooper model addresses _something_ fundamentally important in the gift-economy that is established by its full-tuition scholarship philosophy. As a student, Cooper has demonstrated to me _every single day_ that classroom teaching is an expense worth finding _somebody besides students_ to foot the bill for. While Cooper's administration is larger than it should be, and there is a cost factor there, the problem here is primarily that our administration fails miserably at being exemplary leaders of and swashbuckling advocates for the truly unique institution that _they've_ been given. “No one on the inside”, Shirky laments, “has any clear idea about how to change the way our institutions work while leaving our benefits and privileges intact.” In my experience that is true, and it's exactly where I'd like to pick up. Seeing the Board and President's “Reinvention” process in action over the past year has made it totally clear to me that it is not the college, but the college's unwieldy and ineffective _administration_ that will have to be “reinvented” in order to ensure a future for the mission of free education. While bureaucracy may default to bad failure, I see an opportunity in Cooper for a new administration as forward-thinking as its mission is within today's landscape of higher education.

It may seem pointless to nitpick about meetings and job titles in the middle of a financial crisis, but as Slavin noted, this hole was dug “with secrecy and bad information”. And meetings, it turns out, are both the scene of the crime and a wedge we can use to pry Cooper out of its sinkhole. It was an administrative song and dance that got us into this mess; therefore putting in place tools and workflows that enable our leaders to be more accountable and our governance to be more inclusive will get us out. Implementing the tools and workflows outlined in this essay will help lay solid ground for restoring the trust which is key to Cooper's future as a philanthropically backed institution, reduce costly administrative overhead, and positioning us at the forefront of a necessary renaissance in classroom teaching.

^^^ Slash & merge the last three paragraphs ^^^

Lacking faith in the administration's Hybrid plan and Reinvention process, and feeling like a political problem had generated Cooper's financial problem, I decided to talk to administrators. I was surprised to learn how difficult their jobs are for _no apparent reason_. After each conversation, I found my mind racing with ideas about how all these people could work _better_ to support the school. I sat down to do some research on how administrative bloat affects other colleges and universities, but it practically did itself because, as it turns out, it's an epidemic threatening every institution in America. It took a little more work to find non-fucked-up examples of administration in action, but I found promising systems in areas ranging from the open source programming community to multi-million dollar tech companies to Occupy Wall St. protesters to Cooper's own humble history. The past year has revealed an incredible diversity of opinions within the Cooper community. To strive for something like consensus would discount the vibrancy of these disagreements. I believe we can still, while trumpeting our differences, be united in saving Cooper Union not just as a building or a brand but as an institution of free education, and serve as stewards of its model, sewing the seeds of more amazing tuition-free schools in years to come.

## That's Just How It Is.

Cooper Union's legacy — it's mission, financial and real estate assets, and community of eccentric alumni and professors — are an amazing pedestal on which to stand, but a long history has costs as well as benefits. Anyone who has ever tried to clean an old house knows that's its almost impossible, likewise Cooper is home to 150 years of institutional cobwebs which are no easy task to clean up. We are burdened by politically cloudy flows of information and busted decision-making structures for no reason other than that's how things have always been, or  what they eventually amounted to. When I asked Chairman Epstein about his interest in new structures of administration to match the college's radical mission, he responded curtly, “Cooper Union is unique in many ways. Not governance.” The only explanations I can come up with as to _why_ this is are: the difficulty of refactoring a legacy administration, a vested interest in maintaining power, or ignorance along the lines of teaching old dogs new tricks. If you follow your questions about why our administration works in such confounding ways far enough — just keep asking “Why?” — I can guarantee you will be met with only one answer: that's just how it is. When a fellow student asked Chairman Epstein why we can't have a student and faculty seat on the board, his response was characteristically oblique, “That's not how it works...I have a plane to catch” (Mark Epstein, DATE). Besides my new bureaucrat friends, the only people I've met who feel comfortable answering questions with “because” are babies. If we can't invent and implement systems of administration that can't answer to a simple question, it's going to kill us. (That's just how it is.)

## To Democracy and Beyond

While the bureaucrats at Cooper seem unshakably convinced that their power is descended from god, outside the bubble others are not so sure. Yanis Varoufakis, Chief Economist at multi-million dollar tech company Valve Software, is one heretic in this regard:

> Capitalist corporations are on the way to certain extinction. Replete with hierarchies that are exceedingly wasteful of human talent and energies, intertwined with toxic finance, co-dependent with political structures that are losing democratic legitimacy fast, a form of post-capitalist, decentralised corporation will, sooner or later, emerge. The eradication of distribution and marginal costs, the capacity of producers to have direct access to billions of customers instantaneously, the advances of open source communities and mentalities, all these fascinating developments are bound to turn the autocratic Soviet-like megaliths of today into curiosities that students of political economy, business studies et al will marvel at in the future, just like school children marvel at dinosaur skeletons at the Natural History museum.

There's a lot in there that this essay will break down, even returning to Valve's own corporate structure as an example. But before we dig into emerging tools and structures, take a minute to consider these questions for yourself: If you were to found a free school in 2012 what would its scaffolding look like? Does the size and shape of higher education administrations across the country right now seem effective? Perhaps these are leading questions, but I can hardly imagine how one would even arrive at the intricate stalactites of governance that dominate the higher education landscape, except by the passage of long spans of time.

Dreams, visions, and plans are all sort of foiled right off the bat by an important fact: Cooper isn't even a democracy. In fact, it's not even a public institution, despite its contributions to the public. Cooper Union is a private not-for-profit institution controlled unequivocally by a volunteer board (meaning they do not draw a salary). An important question to ask is: Who does Cooper Union _belong to_? A lawyer would probably tell you it's the Board of Trustees, but at the end of the day I, perhaps delusionally, see Cooper Union as belonging to those it was founded to educate: New York City's youth, to all the students who have since passed through its doors, to all the students it has yet to admit. Framed in this way, the last several decades can be seen as a veritable scandal, a jewel stolen from the people of New York City and the world.

If we can arrive at the untestable yet true assertion Cooper Union belongs to each of us, what should its future look like? Principled, non-coercive, and democratic might be a nice start. While representative democracy may sound alluring to Cooper's oppressed community, we might also take note of Peter Fein's writing off of representative democracy as “government for the age of the horse drawn carriage.” Since we have gotten ourselves into the business of imagining a future administration, we should ask ourselves a question: What comes after representative democracy's horse-drawn carriage? 

## > git init

One place we can take clues from is the world of open source programming. Programmers need to be good at self-organizing because they tend to work under demanding constraints: sometimes separated by thousands of miles but tinkering with the same large, complex, brittle set of code. Why should Cooper's administrators care about a bunch of nerds? In the film Objectified by Gary Hustwit, a designer at home goods company OXO talks about how they design utilitarian vegetable peelers for edge-cases such as people with arthritis and it turns out that all kinds of people say it's the best vegetable peeler they've ever used. Cooper's administrators all share an office and don't write code, but the tools that programmers have invented for themselves to work together without stepping on each other's toes should be of particular interest to someone trying to understand what administrations will look like in the future for many other problems they solve.

It's seems silly that a lot of this could come down to software design. Like the program used to write the bylaws, probably Microsoft Word running on a Mac. Like meetings in the previous section on structure, these things which seem like small details, or even just defaults, are actually the key to understanding how institutions create and distribute information, and are the fulcrum on which we could improve these flows.

Though the invention of the internet connected all types of people to each other, it was a boon for programmers especially. Before the internet, a programmer's collaborators were limited to those close enough in proximity to walk over and stare at the code on their screen. But now anybody could publish their source code online and get instant feedback from other programmers around the world.

Putting these distributed brains in touch meant that software projects were moving faster than ever before. However, this system of writing back and forth was clunky, which led the ever-industrious programmers to imagine how a distributed group of people could stay in the loop about a single project's progression and directly participate in building it, without stepping on anybody's toes or wasting time on back-and-forth communication. What they came up with is called "distributed version control", and the most popular manifestation of it today is called Git.

Git is the name of the most popular distributed version control system right now. Git knocked down the barrier to collaborating on large, complex software projects without centralized organization. It has proven to be such a successful way of working that media theorist [Clay Shirky](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html) thinks these tools and concepts will shape a new generation of governments. Git is kind of like air, there's almost nothing to see. (It's also free, like air.) But what it represents is a whole different mindset in action.

### The Big Red Folder

#### _A visit with_ T.C. Westcott, Vice President of Finance, Administration, and Treasurer

Forensic Accounting

Appointments can be hard to come by at Cooper, because everyone seems to be juggling multiple job titles. As far as I can tell, T.C. Westcott has at _least_ three jobs, including overseeing finances, managing the administration, and also dealing with student issues like sexual harassment. I am grateful to T.C. for the protocol she has set up for fostering communication within the college about our money. Anyone is free to claim a seat, via an online form, at a regularly scheduled series of financial information sessions. 

She goes over to her files and pulls out a red folder. "This is my 'Where Did The Money Go' file", she says. Everybody laughs. I think she's joking. I pray that she is joking. But as it turns out, it isn't always so clear.

A Financial FAQ was posted on Cooper Union's website under the department website of Finance and Administration, run by T.C. Wescott. FAQ's are poor form because they actually stunt conversation. The document has no author. There is confusion about if the Board of Trustees, who all of the decisions of the college ultimately rest on, has seen these answers or agrees with them. Saskia Bos, dean of the School of Art, suggested that they hadn't vetted these answers.

But the worst offense is that each time I went back to access the Financial FAQ, I found that the content and structure of the document had quietly changed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this wasn't the first time I had seen this happen at Cooper. A stir was raised last year when somebody realized that the phrase "full scholarship" had been quietly removed from the school's mission statement posted on the website. It was never clear who made the change, who ordered it, when it happened, and why. It was also not clear why it was changed back. To this day some deny it even happened.

### Be Accountable by Design

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%205.png)

Today's systems give you two options when you want to save your work: you can hit "save" to overwrite the previous version of your document with the one you're currently editing, or use "save as…" to create a copy, preserving the old and current versions of your work as separate files. Once you've initialized  Git in a folder you just keep overwriting the same file with "save". But with each save, you tell Git in a sentence what you changed and it takes care of archiving your versions for you behind the scenes. So instead of saving a version called bylaws-2.doc you just save the file you're working on and tell Git, “added a line about how the president now sits on the board”. Git maintains the original version, your note about what you changed, and the actual bits that were changed. Instead of messy versions of files (or worse, no versions at all!) like in a normal workflow, Git links all historical versions and alternative versions to the actual files. You can now use Git to browse backwards and forwards in time through a history of changes. But that's just the start. It's about to get weird and magical, so buckle up.!

You can also use Git to browse laterally, through alternate universes of what the file you're working on could be. Wait, what? Yes. Alternate universes. That is exactly what I said. Git is designed to run on a network, meaning you can collaborate with people in your office or around the world. Because Git utilizes these descriptive saves (called “commits”) and keeps track of precisely what changed, a potentially unlimited number of people can work together without too much back and forth or stepping on each other's toes. Data lives on a central server but anyone can work on their own version.
![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%208.png)

This means that accountability is built in. Every document contains a log of its commits, who made them, and when. There's no longer the possibility for ambiguity such as saying that the Board of Trustees released a new set of bylaws. If they want to announce that, they still can, but whoever actually made those changes and hit commit — if it was Mark Epstein, the chairman, or Lawrence Cacciatore, the secretary — who told Git what they're changing, will show up. Anyone, if its set up in an open way, can browse this information.

Websites like Tumblr have started to post their policies on Github, so that when they modify these documents everyone who works at Tumblr and their entire community of users can see exactly what changed and when, and access the history of these documents at all times.

For now, vigilante archivists can save copies of websites which appear to be unstable, and independently put together diffs, as I have attempted to do. But these systems can — and should! — be at the core of how these governments function. Git was invented so that programmers could work together more effectively and openly without stepping on each others toes.

### Every Possible Administration: forks and pull-requests

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%209.png)

The most fascinating part of Git is the idea of branches, forks, and pull requests. These are new terms that go beyond the traditional lexicon of “save” or “save as...”. There's a central place where you can see the documents of the school as they are being abided by today. This would be called the master repository. Everyone who edits these documents and anyone in the public who wants to edit them, can do what's called “cloning” the repository. This makes a _copy_ of the documents on their own computer that they can edit as they please. They can then go in firsthand and create their own version of the bylaws whether that means changing the tone, it just fixing a typo, or adding in rules and taking out others. Every person can easily create their own version. This is called a “fork”, like making a fork in the road, I'm taking this main repository ad I'm creating my version of it. Maybe you want to start your own school based on Cooper's governance documents or perhaps you want to make some changes and offer them back to the administration. Once you make your change and you describe to Git what you've changed, you don't have to just brood about your ideal world. You can submit what's called a "pull request" to whoever has the authority to update the master documents that says: this is what I changed, here's a diff showing my specific changes, and here's why I think they should be put into effect. The person who's in charge could hit one button o integrate your changes. 

More respectfully of the community and other moderators, they could creates what's called a branch. Branches are like internal forks. Administrators could simultaneously have multiple versions of a document that aren't the official one. You could create a branch for every new idea, or every upcoming change, or every proposed integration as a step to get details ironed out before you integrate it into the master, which would be the actual official documents of the school. 

Like we saw with Dean Bos, in a bureaucracy people feel stifled. It wastes human energy. It also creates a really inefficient process where people travel up and down a hierarchy representing their little job but also having to put things in a presentation style format, getting a bunch of people in a room, getting them to all look over it, gathering their feedback, taking notes, making changes, probably having another meeting, again escalating up the chain, however these ideas turn into actual changes. There's so much back and forth just with scheduling that sometimes you'll see an email subject line that reads Re: Re: Re: Fwd: Meeting.

"Slideware often reduces the analytical quality of presentations. In particular, the popular PowerPoint templates (ready-made designs) usually weaken verbal and spatial reasoning, and almost always corrupt statistical analysis." writes [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint).

### Direct Action

Git is about direct action. Have an idea? Implement it. Put it out there so that the public can vet it. Give the person who's in charge the possibility of integrating your changes with a click. You're not describing what you want to someone who will turn it into a PowerPoint and hopefully (though we know that's not the case) advocate for you. You are making the change you want to see and then gathering support to make your reality the official one.

### Workflows

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%201.png)

Branching is important. You can not only see the history of every document but all of its futures. If forks represent everyone's ideas, branches of the official documents are like officially sponsored ideas. Branches and forks are all linked with the document, like its history, so that anyone who is interested can spend a little time browsing around and get up to speed with what people want to change.

Working with branches could allow the community to offer feedback on ideas which are candidates for inclusion in the master documents. What a difference this would be from reading a vague announcement in the New York times that everything will be changing. 

### Asynchronous

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%2010.png)

Another thing that's amazing is that this process can be realtime but is asynchronous. You can't say bureaucracy without conjuring fluorescent offices and lengthy meetings. With Git everyone could work from wherever, on what they feel like could best contribute to at that time — maybe it's a sentence, maybe its a rewrite of the whole document. Maybe you worked together with someone: for example, you fork the bylaws and then someone else forks your fork to do copy because you had good ideas and poor grammar. You merge those changes and then submit a pull request that person in charge of Cooper's bylaws integrate it and work on gathering community support so they know this is a plan worth moving ahead with. All of this stuff circumvents the banter, which wastes time.

This is why Github is such an important social network, and maybe why they recently received a $100 million dollar investment. All sorts of messages on Facebook and twitter have meaning, but Github is exclusively about pushing projects forward. The are still ways to have forum style conversations. It's also important to note that this doesn't obviate the need to face to face discussions. It makes them better. And it gives you tools for leaving more precise feedback. Specific at the level of annotating line by line, or literally going up to somebody with the change and giving them the tools to -- if you've done a good job -- Immediately put that change in the pipeline towards becoming reality.

Getting employees to use a set of tools that exposes — in near realtime — logs of changes doesn't just add historical accountability, it actually eliminates the need for most meetings. Instead of preparing a document for review by a group of people and spending hours sitting around a table discussing it, the author in a new administration "commits" their changes as they work and when they are ready invites others to collaborate on the document. There are a number of ways in which this can happen. Indirect complaints and ideas related to the document without actionable solutions can be filed as "issues" in the document's "Bug Tracker". Each issue gets its own discussion forum where members of the working group, community, and even the public can talk about their ideas. If there is dissatisfaction related to a particular part of the document, anybody can leave a comment for that author attached to a specific line, and start a discussion inline. But the most exciting idea is that of the pull request.

### Make History Actionable

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%2012.png)

In a recent discussion of the new bylaws on the Save Cooper Facebook group, somebody wrote, "I haven't combed through yet—anyone see any important changes?" A "diff" (short for "difference") in a way of asking a _computer_ to suss out the differences between these two files, or versions of the same file.

“Diff” comes from the word difference. You can ask Git to tell you what has changed between two versions of a file, or even what is different between any two files. You could do this for the last two versions of a document, say, show me what changed the last time it was edited. But theoretically, if you have a long history in your Git repository, you could say show me a diff of the 1972 bylaws versus the 2012 bylaws. Git would analyze those two texts and show you exactly what changed. If the data was available you'd see who the authors are and what they said they changed, but because of the way that Git keeps track of changes, you wouldn't just be looking at two documents side by side, you'd be looking at a merged, color coded view of the actual edits.On the Facebook group Save Cooper, someone was discussing the recent bylaws and saying, "I haven't had time to read, does anyone know what's changed?" A diff shows you this. It can also work on any type of file, which is fascinating. For example, someone differ their haircut so you can drag a slider back and forth and see the difference. And here I've put together a diff of the cooper bylaws that you can play with.

If you've ever used the Track Changes feature while writing a paper, a diff should be instantly familiar to you.

Cool, right? Diffs make it simple for anyone to directly assess what has changed between edits. Unfortunately, it was a lot of work for me to put together this example because of the disorganized manner in which information is released at Cooper Union. I had to copy and paste the most recent version of the bylaws out of the PDF file in which the Trustees released them, search the internet for an old version of the bylaws (which I was eventually able to find on the Cooper library website, although it's from 1972 jesus christ), manually diff the paragraphs, and then code up the quick visualization you see above.

How it actually happened. Nobody was consulted. And the bylaws were published in two totally different formats in two totally different areas of the website. ELABORATE.

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/bylaws-now.png)

The thing that is hard to believe is that if the authors of this document (the authorship is currently unclear) were to start managing this file with Git today, tomorrow's edits would include automatically generated diffs. Accountability so close I can practically taste its public-facing versions. Why isn't this happening? IDK. Student council is ON IT.

### Bedbugs in the Office

#### _A visit with_ Alan Wolf, Acting Dean of the School of Engineering and Professor of Physics

Alan Wolf is a professor of physics, acting dean of the School of Engineering, _and_ the college's safety coordinator. At an all school meeting he recounted an experience dealing with a bedbug scare in the offices at 30 Cooper. Wolf had to walk to each floor of the offices at 30 Cooper to brief the employees on the building's upcoming fumigation. "Who are these people?!" he wondered, when he saw the floors and floors of employees pour out of their cubicles.

Cooper currently leases 7 floors of office space at 30 Cooper Square at a cost of $X million a year. When the lease came up for renewal this year, many groups such as Friends of Cooper Union publicly encouraged the administration to save money by consolidating and relocating these administrative employees. The college renewed the lease.

President Bharucha has called Cooper Union a "tight ship", but this appears to me to contradict a story Dean Wolf told to students of a time when Cooper's administrative employees totaled something like five people working out of the former Hewitt building. Wolf says that when he asked T.C. Westcott, Vice President of Finance, Administration, and Treasurer, what all these people in the offices do, she told him that running a college today isn't the same as it was when Wolf was a student here. Today, Westcott says, there are much stricter accounting and reporting requirements for institutions, making it necessary to have hoardes of secretarial employees on hand to deal with the constant filing. 

However, humanities professor (and former dean of the School of Art) Dore Ashton _also_ recounted to me a time when the College ran just fine with a set of administrators countable on two hands. "You know what I learned when I ran the School of Art?" she says, "It's not that hard! I called a meeting once a semester and I invited everyone from the faculty to the custodians. They fired me because I didn't hold enough meetings." Administrative bloat is not just a problem, it's a worldview. And, as Bloomberg Businessweek reports, an cultural virus that is infecting schools across the nation. <<Businessweek quote>>. Similarly, in the last 10 years, administrative costs at Cooper Union have risen at a rapid pace, while the size of the school's faculty and students has stayed the same. Are stricter requirements for reporting really to blame?


Counting through a breakdown of the school's employees, T.C. Westcott reported to me that today there are just over _a hundred_ staff and administrators _not_ embedded in the three schools, meaning purely administrative departments like admissions and records, development, alumni relations, public relations, finance, and the office of the president. How did we get here?

### The Anti-Smoking Gun

#### _A visit with_ Francois De Menil, Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees

To actually meet with the trustees for a conversation, I had to jump through some hoops. Basically, getting elected to Art Student Council and then ratified as the student representative to the Board Chairman Committee. This entailed getting the seniors in the School of Art to: check their email within a two day voting period, click a link, select my name, and submit the form. The problem, as it turned out, wasn't galvanizing support from fellow students, but getting anyone to actually check their school email. I was informed that if more than half of class didn't vote for either me, my opponent, or a write-in, that the entire vote would be thrown out and _nobody would receive the seat_. This meant that I spent the closing day of the election sprinting around the school with my laptop offering to let people log into their email then and there and vote for whomever they wish, just so that the vote didn't get thrown out. While the voting process was made formal to the point of being difficult for most students, the deadline was never properly announced and it wasn't clear who had even set it. After running to every studio in the school, the threshold was passed. Shortly after, I received a text message that I had won. Phew.

In our first Board Chair meeting I talked about tools for accountability and how I wanted access to historical documents and records of decision-making. To this request Francois De Menil, Vice-Chairman of the Board, responded, "you're not going to find a smoking gun." After the, um, ominous moment of silence that followed his remark, I tried to make it clear that accountability has nothing to do with a smoking gun. It's about opening up the processes of governing Cooper to broader community involvement. As Slavin said in his speech, it would be idiotic to invest in a company that _won't tell you_ how they make decisions.

“Democracy,” [says Fein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsW4rAS1gao), “is government for the age of the horse-drawn carriage.” Representative democracy, he explains, use to be necessary because it wasn't possible for every citizen to convene in the same place at the same time. But if local groups could elect a representative, and that representative could go off and meet with other representatives, a kind of democracy could take place. The telegraph and the computer, personal electronic means of communication, broke down these barriers. The problem with representatives, as we have seen at Cooper, is that they often can't be said to properly represent us. In Daedelus, John Dunn writes how "founding father" James Madison, believed that, "Representation would enhance democracy not by rendering it more democratic, but by preventing it from acting hastily, unwisely, and destructively." (REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING??) Today, when technology has made direct, realtime communication at a scale resembling Cooper's entirely plausible, Dunn has a hard time justifying the benefits of representation over direct democracy, conceding only to the _possibility_ of, "somnambulistic collective greed or stupidity."

Bureaucracy is stifling. In a hierarchical organization responsibilities are divided up and encapsulated arbitrarily. This division of labor creates a lack of responsibility: it's not my job, it's not my problem. In reality saving this school is everyone's problem and everyone's input should be equally valued. Hierarchies like the one in place at Cooper divide it so that administrators can waste time fulfilling their job requirements. You can't put your best ideas forward, instead you must perform your role. This is demonstrated most interestingly by the fact that our dean says even if she opposes tuition she must work on proposals including it because that is her job.

The balance of power is weird. It's often not clear who to blame or who's in power. The president reports to the board, the board communicates through the president, the president communicates with the public through press releases and the media (and apparently this is also protocol for “communicating” with students).

Openness. Hierarchies create granular levels of access, and in the past year we've seen lots of previously unreleased information be made public as the administration has vowed to be “transparent”. But there are still different levels of access. People face eachother in different ways, this is just human nature. You talk to your boss differently than your professors than your friends than your mom. Bureaucracy allows to much of and even nurtures these personal and group politics.

Accountability. It's not clear who writes things, it's not clear who has read them, it's not clear when they change, and it's difficult to find previous versions of things.

Money. The president, Vice Presidents, deans, secretaries. All these people cost a lot of money. And they don't represent us well. While reducing administrative costs won't fix the budget shortfall, it has the potential to strengthen the school in a way that could save it by foregrounding the community's dedication to free education.

Framing the issue in terms of removing barriers is brilliant, but the ending leaves something to be desired.

> "If we can articulate a model that secures the credible promise of education without barriers...we will [unleash]...new geographies of knowledge beyond our wildest imaginations."
>
> David Gersten, Professor, School of Architecture at Cooper Union 

Here's the thing: the model has been articulated. The actual challenge is that new barriers have emerged in time...from within.

### Legacy

Cooper Union's legacy provides an amazing history on which to stand, but also the cruft of old policies of inefficiencies. In a talk at the Personal Democracy Forum, [Peter Fein noted](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsW4rAS1gao) that legacy is notoriously difficult to shake. The Cooper Union exists today in *spite* of its deadlocked bureaucracy, who lack the accountability, transparency, and audacity that keeping the promise of free education demands. We are burdened by politically cloudy flows of information and busted decision-making structures for no reason other than that's how things have always worked. The board stopped believing in free education a long time ago and now they're resigned to looking at Cooper as a numbers game. Their feeling of responsibility for financial debts is stronger than their resolve to fight for Cooper's unique program of education students chosen by nothing besides merit and awarded full-scholarships. It's not the perfect model, and it's one of many. But the community has articulated why Cooper needs to exist. Why couldn't we run this place? The college must take the risk of doubling down on its unique, radical, and as of yet unbroken promise of free education to all to attract substantial philanthropy.

If you follow your questions about why our administration works in such confounding ways far enough, I can guarantee you will be met with only one answer: that's just how it is.

Why can't we have a student and faculty seat on the Board?

> "That's not how it works...I have a plane to catch."Mark Epstein, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Cooper Union 

There are a million reasons why this won't work. If we can't invent and implement new systems of administration that break down these barriers and make this ridiculous non-answer go away, it's going to kill us. That's just how it is.


### Not my job, not my problem

Why is the dean of the School of Art paid $241,966 a year to NOT advocate to the president a plan that embodies her students' opposition to tuition? The flows of information are politically cloudy. For example, when, at a meeting with her students in the School of Art, dean Saskia Bos was asked why she couldn't advocate for The Way Forward, a plan not involving tuition which many of her students find compelling, she said, “it's not my job to tell the president what to do.” The scary part is that Dean Bos may be right. The larger issue is not why she won't advocate for us on this matter, but why we are both stifled by this so called democracy? Whose job _is it_ to tell the president what to do? Whose job should it be? At the end of the day are office politics getting in the way of doing the right thing?

> "It&apos;s not my job to tell the president what to do."Saskia Bos, Dean, School of Art at Cooper Union

### Saving face is a financial liability

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%206.png)

The administration has said that social media protests and slandering, combined with a low alumni contribution rate, get in the way of the administrations ability to raise money. The Chairman of the board said something to the effect of: philanthropists see those things and just laugh. What this makes clear is that the administration is costing the school a lot of money, not representing the desires of its community, and doing a bad job selling the school to philanthropists.

A former dean of the school told me that what they learned when they served in that position is that it's *not* that hard to run this place. She was fired, she said, for not holding enough meetings. 

We need to do what is right and not what looks good. Lying to save face got us into this mess, as Kevin points out. But it also doesn't present a very compelling vision of the school. It presents a bland vision of something that's unique and radical. It's appealing to be honest about mistakes and completely open about decisions.

Cooper has always been philanthropically backed. But a large development office that advertises a milquetoast vision of the school doesn't make for a very compelling investment opportunity, to investors but especially to alumni.

> It is not that: The Cooper Union holds up free education, but that free education holds up The Cooper Union. It is not that: we can no longer afford to: freely educate, but that we cannot afford to break the promise of Free Education. The largest single financial asset that the Cooper Union currently holds is its promise of free education: TO ALL. The value contained within this promise far exceeds our current endowment as well as the physical properties held by the institution including the land under the Chrysler Building. Our challenge and obligation, our social contract, is to comprehend and make more understandable how to mobilize the resources contained within this promise.David Gersten, Professor, School of Architecture at Cooper Union 

If our Board of Trustees and administrators can't articulate our school's radical missions — instead opting to invest in bubbles like the market for higher education, and follow the status quo by trying to expand this university into a global brand through online courses — 

### Workflows

### Cost

This doesn't _add_ manpower or require additional investment. It just becomes part of everyone's job to specify what they are working on. In fact, it may even make some secretarial and communications positions fall away.

### Avoiding the Technological Steamroller

Technology can gave a steamroller effect so we have to be careful not to technologies things blindly. However, these bureaucratic processes could be much mor effective. They've already started technologizing the wrong parts of how administration functions at Cooper. There are some areas however such as registration, where Cooper has begun integrating expensive systems such as Datatel (or whatever it's called now) which apparently cost a couple million dollars and Wil allow st.udents to register online for classes. At least in the art school registration is handled by three people: Joyce, Judith, and sometimes Day. It's wonderful.

But there are other parts of the educational experience that are being wrong-footedly technologized. Class registration in the School of Art is handled largely by two people: Joyce, Judith, and Day. Whereas 

This type of restructuring isn't a magic panacea, in fact, if it is handled without tact, like in the case of class registration, it can actually cause more harm than good.

### Technocracy

Some might call the propositions of this essay technocratic, a fear that people who understand technology will control everything. That's not the point. The point isn't making it more exclusive, it's making it more open. Even people who don't use Facebook or Twitter or Github could find representation could find it in a friend or an official. But those who have ideas and are willing to put in the work (something we've seen in proposals like the way forward) would benefit from tools that provide a framework for directly contributing to procedures of governance and a more even distribution of power.

This is also interesting from a financial standpoint because the administration has done many thing to isolate alumni. This potentially bring them back into the fold by strengthening ties with them and letting them get more involved.


### Aren't these just words on a screen? (Success stories from Valve, Github, and 37 Signals)

Not all companies that are using these types of tools and workflows turn into horizontal anarchies. But I'm convinced that if we can get these tools into use at Cooper Union and allow them to relieve some of the broken flows of information it would cause poorly the functioning administration to crumble. Of course, as Clay Shirky writes, "Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution." However, there is simply no case for a bloated bureaucracy lording over a community so smart and capable of self-organization.

> "Conversations on Facebook and Twitter have purposes, but at GitHub, there is real pressure to move a project along and keep it alive." [John Norman](http://7fff.com/2012/07/14/the-most-important-social-network-github/) 

This is what it might look like if Cooper's administration started managing their documents with Git and Github. In fact, I've already registered it and put some documents up. I've already reduced the barrier of entry by helping the administration start this project. Git makes it easy for them to assume ownership whenever they're ready.

### Case Study: Valve: flatten hierarchies and collaborate horizontally

> Capitalist corporations are on the way to certain extinction. Replete with hierarchies that are exceedingly wasteful of human talent and energies, intertwined with toxic finance, co-dependent with political structures that are losing democratic legitimacy fast, a form of post-capitalist, decentralised corporation will, sooner or later, emerge. The eradication of distribution and marginal costs, the capacity of producers to have direct access to billions of customers instantaneously, the advances of open source communities and mentalities, all these fascinating developments are bound to turn the autocratic Soviet-like megaliths of today into curiosities that students of political economy, business studies et al will marvel at in the future, just like school children marvel at dinosaur skeletons at the Natural History museum.Yanis Varoufakis, Chief Economist, Valve Software 

People don't have bosses. They decide on what they work on.

All desks have wheels. Employees can unplug their desks from the wall and plug back in wherever they want. Anyone inside the office can visit a special page that shows a live map of who is plugged in where.

Some of this stuff sounds new-agey. Employees don't have to work from any specific place at an specific time, they just have to get their work done. "You don't have to come into the office every day if you don't feel like it", writes Zach Holman, a developer at Github, "(although most of the time everyone comes in)."

### *Enlighten* the Board of Trustees

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/Administration%20Drawing%204.png)

All decisions come down to the Board of Trustees. They elect themselves—and their friends. We are not allowed to sit in on their meetings. The minutes kept of their meetings are confidential. We have been told that the Cooper community has no recourse against the decisions they make. We are only allowed to communicate with them in shallow ways like staid Q&As or a one-way airing of grievances (like when we were invited into their meeting).

While a third of the board consists of alumni, and the president, secretary, and treasurer also attend meetings, the majority of the board is only called to campus four times a year for meetings. They undoubtedly carry on discussions outside the walls of the school. Whilele a board draws together philanthropists and executives with various areas of expertise to manage an institution, how is anybody who brushes with the institution's day-to-day life four times a year supposed to be able to understand the needs and desires of this place? The short answer is that they don't. They have nearly sunken this place.

I don't think that having a board — something which is etched into the school's inviolable charter, and also characterizes all non-profits in New York — is inherently bad. Other people love their boards.

"There is one important aspect of Valve that I did not focus on: the link between its horizontal management structure and its 'vertical' ownership structure. Valve is a private company owned mostly by few individuals. In that sense, it is an enlightened oligarchy: an oligarchy in that it is owned by a few and enlightened in that those few are not using their property rights to boss people around."

Why is Cooper's board oppressive rather than enlightened?

### Model student services after 37 Signals Customer Support. Distributed. Remote.

![](../../content/reinventing-administration/read/img/f-a-t-orgchart.png) 

A sketch abstracting the complicated hierarchical organization of Cooper Union's department of Finance and Administation.

### Scale

Github has 35 employees (update this #, from 2011)

Valve has 300 employees (update this #)

But both of those teams are responsible for hundreds of thousands of customers. 

How radically could we scale back the size of our administration, responsible for 900 students and 200(?) faculty/staff, by implementing systems such as these. I've heard from somebody who works in 30 Cooper that despite their proximity to the school, they don't get to interact with students enough.

[Can I estimate what Cooper's scale would be?]


### Students ahead of the curve

Wanna see this idea in action? Look to the students. Andrew Crudge (and a friend of his, I think) built a website to allocate and manage the $60,000 offered to clubs and activities within Cooper. It practically exudes accountability but is still somehow fun to use. Poke around the history. No secrets or mysteries here! http://jac.cooper.edu

[grab quote(s) from Readmill)

When you design a chair, think about the chair in the room, think about the room in the city, and think about the city on the planet, and so on. If you want to design a building out of wood, you will find that building code prevents that due to an old rule about fires, but now there are new types of fireproof lumber. So, to make the building happen, the designers had to deal with the city's legal code. This type of invisible surrounding circumstance is what Hill calls "dark matter". And while a design can certainly emanate an idea that changes its surroundings, sometimes you must work from the outside in. Hill posits that by shaping "dark matter" like building codes or bureaucratic structures you can make possible the thing that sits at the center.

### Governments designed to shrink

Maybe it takes a large administration to start a school. How can an administration be built to shrink rather than grow?
