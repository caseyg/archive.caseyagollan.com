## WTF Happened at Cooper Union

In June 2009 the _Wall Street Journal_ reported that one college, Cooper Union, had "sidestepped the crisis". How was it that colleges and universities across America, some charging their students as much as $60,000 a year in tuition, seemed to be having a hard time paying their bills, while a college that grants a full-tuition scholarship to every single one of its 1000 students had just erected a shiny new building in Manhattan and was floating on a pool of cash? We may never know, because just over two years later in October 2011 Cooper Union's newly appointed President Jamshed Bharucha announced a very different story to the _New York Times_: the college is broke and has actually been digging itself into debt for several decades. Because of the positive press in recent years, almost nobody in the Cooper community — students, faculty, staff, alumni, friends, and neighbors — had suspected anything notable was even going on until picking up that copy of the _Times_. Bharucha's announcement triggered confusion, anger, and an unraveling of messy administrative narratives. 

Cooper Union has historically relied on two main sources of money to fund the free education it provides: big-time philanthropists and unconventional real estate deals. Back when the college's board consisted of Peter Cooper, Abraham Hewitt, and three of their friends, the trustees would allegedly look at the deficit at the end of each year, divide it by five, and each write a check. If Peter Cooper could meet his namesake's board and administration as they exist today he would probably die all over again out of heartbreak or rage. “There are _how many_ hundreds of administrators suckling on the endowment? They want to charge students for _what_?” In the past several decades, the board has steadily sold off the college's real estate assets to fund increasing, unchecked expenses and fulfill the goals of an expansionist “master plan” (which the trustees admit “were not achieved as anticipated”). In 2006, for example, they deemed it prudent to take out a $175 million dollar loan to build a shiny new building, putting up the college's most famous asset, the land beneath the Chrysler Building, as collateral. With a portion of the building's costs eventually offset by a capital campaign, the gigantic loan _actually_ went towards keeping the school running in its growth pattern long enough for former President Campbell to retire with his bonus payments intact. In the aftermath of mismanagement — bad strategies executed poorly for decades — the college is left with nothing left to sell, a threadbare endowment, a $16 million structural deficit, and an administration that will no longer defend the school's bedrock mission of providing free education based on merit alone.

## The Hybrid Model, or How to Throw 1000 People Under The Bus and Look Good Doing It

President Bharucha issued a vague mandate that the college must be “reinvented for the 21st century”, but what he was really saying is this, “Altering our scholarship policy will be only as a last resort, but in order to create a sustainable model, it has to be one of the options on the table.” Or in other words while the administration “gets” the value of Cooper Union's full-tuition scholarships for all, they consider it to be _just a feature_, something that is detachable as a “last resort”. Begrudgingly putting aside philosophy for a minute, President Bharucha's reasoning about a sustainable business model _still_ makes no sense, because as David Gersten, a Professor in the School of Architecture, points out:

> It is not that: The Cooper Union holds up free education, but that free education holds up The Cooper Union. It is not that: we can no longer afford to: freely educate, but that we cannot afford to break the promise of Free Education. The largest single financial asset that the Cooper Union currently holds is its promise of free education: TO ALL. The value contained within this promise far exceeds our current endowment as well as the physical properties held by the institution including the land under the Chrysler Building. Our challenge and obligation, our social contract, is to comprehend and make more understandable how to mobilize the resources contained within this promise.

Indeed, providing 1000 educations free of charge in a time when American students have amassed over a trillion dollars in student loans is an extraordinary act to be carrying out at this very moment. And while raising money for this purpose is an unimaginably _complex_ job, it is not very _complicated_. President Bharucha's unnervingly boilerplate speeches about working together on a sustainable future serve basically as an admission: he cannot raise the $400 million dollars we need. He will not. _His way_ is that of the bureaucrat: abhorring hard, simple risk and feeding on measured, micro-managed complication. 

Thus, as if to caricature its own distended form, the administration declared an official "Reinvention process”: Two “task forces” of students, alumni, and faculty were formed to _have meetings_ on a regular basis until they could deliver reports on expense reduction and revenue generation. Two consulting firms were hired _indefinitely_ to hang around running the numbers on various revenue generating schemes. Chairman Epstein held a disastrous Q&A Forum in which he confirmed to the furious Cooper community that they have “no recourse” against board decisions and he told a room full of alumni that he considers them a “failed investment” (a quote which still stings despite a later apology). The board hired yet another _consultant_ to answer the question: how can they be a better board. Hm. Faculty were given a timespan of a few _weeks_ to come up with revenue generating programs, and were threatened that if they didn't their respective schools would be shuttered.

By all accounts (except the President's!) the process has been inane, but what is _distressing_ about it is its underlying mentality known as “Responsibility Centered Management”. President Bharucha formally charged the deans of each school with presenting a plan to generate a given amount of revenue per year. The deans in turn passed the task of authoring the form and content of these revenue generating programs to their faculty. Suddenly the Hybrid Model had the whole school spending their nights and weekends drafting specs for a plan that reads like a _joke_: fund a free school by simultaneously operating a _very expensive_ school that does not yet exist. In theory this approach's division of labor ensures that those with the most hands-on knowledge get to contribute to the specifics of planning, but it fails to account for a grave misunderstanding at the root of the charge about the efficacy and conflict of interest of generating revenue from educational programs, while also making the plan politically complicated if not impossible for mid-level administrators and untenured faculty (which is almost everyone) to oppose. In Cooper's case, it also sets back the institution's intellectual pace by distributing the stress and responsibility of revenue generation to faculty who should be focused on teaching students, and deflects blame away from the board for mismanagement by forcefully distributing a pre-determined plan's ownership and authorship. Having the future in one's hands has never, ever been less empowering.

## Same Shit, Different Decade

Even if the Board Chairman and President woke up tomorrow and decided to double-down on the school's promise of free education, have they shown they can handle the money? Sadly, as alumni and adjunct professor Kevin Slavin notes, the answer is no:

> If someone asked you for $10,000 and had a board of people who were going to spend it, and no one was supervising them — no one! — and they were accountable to no one — no one! — and if you asked, can I find out what you guys are even talking about and they said — no! — and you said, can I even talk to you — and they said — no! — would you invest in that? If it were for profit, would you believe that it would be likely to be profitable? And yet, that’s where we are. Can you imagine a company, in a crisis, that would bar the NYT, Reuters, and the Wall Street Journal from the room — from this room! The Great Hall! — and bring it’s chairman to address its shareholders who will only answer prepared questions with a lawyer at his side? What is produced in a spectacle like that? What is consumed? What is exhausted? Transparency is not a promise. It’s not an idea. It’s action.

On the brink of collapse, Cooper's administration has vowed to be “transparent”. This means that they posted some financial documents on the website one time and started holding office hours. These moves are not fundamental enough to demonstrate that transparency has in fact been integrated into the future operations of the institution. When I asked if the administration would keep posting financial documents after the crisis has subsided, Chairman Epstein seemed confused as to why I'd want to keep seeing them. What the administration has been slow to understand is that transparency could be a way of life for this institution, not just lipgloss on the bloated pig of administration. Slavin's speech makes the case that changes to the _mechanics_ of Cooper's administration that make it more trustworthy and communicative are this institution's first step towards recovery and maybe its only real option.

It has been painful to come to terms with the fact that the past decades of mismanagement are water under the bridge; that we can't undo the mistakes we didn't realize were being made behind closed doors. What we _can_ do is put in place systems that foster open, accountable communication and more democratic structures of decision-making. While the problem facing Cooper Union is financial, the solution will be political. The problem right now is that some of the actors have changed but it's the same power structure which got us into this mess that continues to bungle getting us out. This is what designer Dan Hill calls a “non-learning system” (Let's not dwell for _too_ long on the irony that institutions of higher education appear to be some of the slowest learners): 

> There is good failure and bad failure. The former is failure that enables a system to learn, becoming more resilient, more adept. The latter is exhibited within a non-learning system. Are these non-learning systems due to their fundamentally out-of-control characteristics, systems whose complexity has grown beyond our comprehension and capability? Or is it simply that policy is too dislocated from its realisation?

Seeing “bad failure” abound, many have already moved on from _higher education_ as we know it, perhaps including some of our own trustees who have dropped off in the past year. In a recent essay, professor and media theorist Clay Shirky rightly points out that education today is not worth what students are being charged for it, and that the internet might offer alternatives to going into debt for education. Citing a “cost disease” in higher education, he writes, "institution-specific explanations—spoiled students expecting a climbing wall; management self-aggrandizement at the expense of educational mission—hold up less well than the generic observation: colleges need a lot of highly skilled people, people whose wages, benefits, and support costs have risen faster than inflation for the last thirty years." This where Cooper's model shines hope into Shirky's world. He sees higher education being necessarily reduced, half as common sense and half as a compromise, to something like interactive recorded lectures. Technology will create amazing possibilities, but classroom teaching need not be pitted against online courses. We should think of the two more like cousins. Even if it's tough to make ends meet with classroom teaching, the gift-economy that is established by Cooper Union's full-tuition scholarship philosophy addresses half the problem Shirky points out about overpriced and too-expensive education. As a student, Cooper has demonstrated to me _every single day_ that higher education is an expense worth finding somebody besides students to foot the bill for. 

While Cooper's administration is larger than it should be, and there is a cost factor there, the problem here is primarily that our administration fails miserably at being exemplary leaders of and swashbuckling advocates for the truly unique institution that _they've_ been given. “No one on the inside”, Shirky laments, “has any clear idea about how to change the way our institutions work while leaving our benefits and privileges intact.” In my experience that that's true, and it's exactly where I'd like to pick up. Seeing the Board and President's “Reinvention” process in action over the past year has made it totally clear to me that it is not the college, but the college's unwieldy and ineffective _administration_ that will have to be “reinvented” in order to ensure a future for the mission of free education.

Lacking faith in the administration's Hybrid plan and Reinvention process, and feeling like a political problem had generated Cooper's financial problem, I decided to talk to administrators. I was surprised to learn how difficult their jobs are for _no apparent reason_. After each conversation, I found my mind racing with ideas about how all these people could work _better_ to support the school. It may seem boring or pointless to nitpick about administrative meetings and job titles in the middle of a financial crisis, but as Slavin noted, this hole was dug “with secrecy and bad information”. Meetings, it turns out, are both the scene of the crime and a wedge we can use to pry Cooper out of its sinkhole. I also sat down to do some research on how administrative bloat affects other colleges and universities, but it practically did itself because, as it turns out, it's an epidemic threatening every institution in America. It took a little more work to find non-fucked-up examples of administration in action, but I found promising systems in places like the open source programming community, multi-million dollar tech companies, and Cooper's own humble history.

It was an administrative song and dance that got us into this mess; and putting in place tools and workflows that enable our leaders to be more accountable and our governance to be more inclusive will get us out. Bureaucracy may default to “bad failure” in times of crisis, but I see an opportunity in Cooper to try for a new administration, as forward-thinking as the college's mission is within today's landscape of higher education. Implementing the tools and workflows outlined in this essay would lay solid ground for restoring the trust which is key to Cooper's future as a philanthropically backed institution, reduce costly administrative overhead, and work towards positioning us at the forefront of a movement in tuition-free classroom teaching. 

## That's Just How It Is.

Cooper Union's legacy — it's mission, financial and real estate assets, and community of eccentric alumni and professors — are an amazing pedestal on which to stand, but a long history has costs as well as benefits. Anyone who has ever tried to clean an old house knows that's its almost impossible, likewise Cooper is home to 150 years of institutional cobwebs which are no easy task to dust up. We are burdened by politically cloudy flows of information and busted decision-making structures for no reason other than that's how things have always been, or  what they eventually amounted to. When I asked Chairman Epstein about his interest in new structures of administration to match the college's radical mission, he responded curtly, “Cooper Union is unique in many ways. Not governance.” The only explanations I can come up with as to _why_ this is are: the difficulty of refactoring a legacy administration, a vested interest in maintaining power, or ignorance along the lines of teaching old dogs new tricks. If you follow your questions about why our administration works in such confounding ways far enough — just keep asking “Why?” — I can guarantee you will be met with only _one_ answer: that's just how it is. When a fellow student asked Chairman Epstein why we can't have a student and faculty seat on the board, his response was characteristically oblique, “That's not how it works...I have a plane to catch”. Not to fling too many insults, but aside from my new bureaucrat friends, the only other people I've met who answer questions with “because” are toddlers. If we can't invent and implement systems of administration that can answer up to simple questions, it's going to kill us. (That's just how it works.)

## To Democracy and Beyond

The bureaucrats at Cooper seem unshakably convinced that their knowledge and power are descended from God; outside the bubble, others are not so sure. Yanis Varoufakis, Chief Economist at multi-million dollar company Valve Software, is one heretic in this regard:

> Capitalist corporations are on the way to certain extinction. Replete with hierarchies that are exceedingly wasteful of human talent and energies, intertwined with toxic finance, co-dependent with political structures that are losing democratic legitimacy fast, a form of post-capitalist, decentralised corporation will, sooner or later, emerge. The eradication of distribution and marginal costs, the capacity of producers to have direct access to billions of customers instantaneously, the advances of open source communities and mentalities, all these fascinating developments are bound to turn the autocratic Soviet-like megaliths of today into curiosities that students of political economy, business studies et al will marvel at in the future, just like school children marvel at dinosaur skeletons at the Natural History museum.

There's a lot in there that this essay will break down, even returning to Valve's own corporate structure as an example. But before we dig into emerging tools and structures, take a minute to consider these questions for yourself: If you were to found a free school in 2012 what would its scaffolding look like? Does the size and shape of higher education administrations across the country right now seem effective? Perhaps these are leading questions, but I can hardly imagine how one would even arrive at the intricate stalactites of governance that dominate the higher education landscape, except by the passage of long spans of time.

Dreams, visions, and plans are all sort of foiled right off the bat by an important fact: Cooper isn't even a democracy. In fact, it's not even a public institution, despite its contributions to the public. Cooper Union is a private not-for-profit institution controlled unequivocally by a volunteer board (meaning they do not draw a salary). An important question to ask is: Who does Cooper Union _belong to_? A lawyer would probably tell you it's the Board of Trustees, but at the end of the day I, perhaps delusionally, see Cooper Union as belonging to those it was founded to educate: New York City's youth, to all the students who have since passed through its doors, to all the students it has yet to admit. Framed in this way, the last several decades can be seen as a veritable scandal, a jewel stolen from the people of New York City and the world.

If we can arrive at the untestable yet true assertion Cooper Union belongs to each of us, what should its future look like? Principled, non-coercive, and democratic might be a nice start. While representative democracy may sound alluring to Cooper's oppressed community, we might also take note of Peter Fein's writing off of representative democracy as “government for the age of the horse drawn carriage.” Since we have gotten ourselves into the business of imagining a future administration, we should ask ourselves a question: What comes after representative democracy's horse-drawn carriage?

One place we can take clues from is the world of open source programming. Programmers need to be good at self-organizing because they tend to work under demanding constraints: sometimes separated by thousands of miles but tinkering with the same large, complex, brittle set of code. Why should Cooper's administrators care about a bunch of nerds? In the film Objectified by Gary Hustwit, a designer at home goods company OXO talks about how they design utilitarian vegetable peelers for edge-cases such as people with arthritis and it turns out that all kinds of people say it's the best vegetable peeler they've ever used. Cooper's administrators all share an office and don't write code, but the tools that programmers have invented for themselves to work together without stepping on each other's toes should be of particular interest to someone trying to understand what administrations will look like in the future for many other problems they solve.

It's seems silly that a lot of this could come down to software design. Like the program used to write the bylaws, probably Microsoft Word running on a Mac. Like meetings in the previous section on structure, these things which seem like small details, or even just defaults, are actually the key to understanding how institutions create and distribute information, and are the fulcrum on which we could improve these flows.

Though the invention of the internet connected all types of people to each other, it was a boon for programmers especially. Before the internet, a programmer's collaborators were limited to those close enough in proximity to walk over and stare at the code on their screen. But now anybody could publish their source code online and get instant feedback from other programmers around the world.

Putting these distributed brains in touch meant that software projects were moving faster than ever before. However, this system of writing back and forth was clunky, which led the ever-industrious programmers to imagine how a distributed group of people could stay in the loop about a single project's progression and directly participate in building it, without stepping on anybody's toes or wasting time on back-and-forth communication. What they came up with is called "distributed version control", and the most popular manifestation of it today is called Git.

Git is the name of the most popular distributed version control system right now. Git knocked down the barrier to collaborating on large, complex software projects without centralized organization. It has proven to be such a successful way of working that media theorist [Clay Shirky](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html) thinks these tools and concepts will shape a new generation of governments. Git is kind of like air, there's almost nothing to see. (It's also free, like air.) But what it represents is a whole different mindset in action.
