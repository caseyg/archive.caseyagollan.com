<h2 id="wtf-happened-at-cooper-union" style="margin-top:-200px;">WTF Happened at Cooper Union</h2>

<div class="two-col" markdown="1">
In June 2009 the [Wall Street Journal reported][1] that one college, Cooper Union, had “sidestepped the crisis”. How was it that colleges and universities across America, some charging their students as much as $60,000 a year in tuition, seemed to be having a hard time paying their bills, while a college that grants a full-tuition scholarship to every single one of its 1000 students had just erected a shiny new building in Manhattan and was floating on a pool of cash? We may never know, because just over two years later in October 2011 Cooper Union's newly appointed President Jamshed Bharucha announced [a very different story][2] to the New York Times: the college is broke and has actually been digging itself into debt for several decades. Because of the positive press in recent years, almost nobody in the Cooper community — students, faculty, staff, alumni, friends, and neighbors — had suspected anything notable was even going on until picking up that copy of the Times. Bharucha's announcement triggered confusion, anger, and an unraveling of messy administrative narratives.

Cooper Union has historically relied on two main sources of money to fund the free education it provides: big-time philanthropists and unconventional real estate deals. Back when the college's board consisted of five members including Andrew Carnegie and J. Pierpont Morgan, the trustees would [allegedly][3] look at the deficit at the end of each year, divide it by five, and each write a check. If the college’s founder Peter Cooper could meet his namesake's board and administration as they exist today he would die all over again out of heartbreak or rage. “There are how many administrators suckling on the endowment? They want to charge students for what?” In the past several decades, the board has steadily sold off the college's real estate assets to fund increasing, unchecked expenses and fulfill the goals of an expansionist “master plan” (which the trustees [meekly admit][4] “were not achieved as anticipated”). In 2006, for example, they deemed it prudent to take out a $175 million loan to build a shiny new building, putting up the college's most famous asset, the land beneath the Chrysler Building, as collateral. With a portion of the building's costs eventually offset by a capital campaign, the gigantic loan actually went towards keeping the school running in its growth pattern long enough for former President Campbell to retire with his bonus payments intact. In the aftermath of mismanagement — bad strategies executed poorly for decades — the college is left with nothing to sell, a threadbare endowment, a $16 million structural deficit, and an administration that refuses to defend the school's bedrock mission of providing free education based on merit alone.

<h2 id="the-hybrid-model" style="width:40%;margin-top:-275px;">The Hybrid Model<strong>, <br />or <em>How to Throw 1000 People Under The Bus and Look Good Doing It</em></strong></h2>

<div class="center" markdown="1">
President Bharucha issued a [vague mandate][5] that the college must be “reinvented for the 21st century”, but what he was really saying is [this][2], “Altering our scholarship policy will be only as a last resort, but in order to create a sustainable model, it has to be one of the options on the table.” Or in other words while the administration “gets” the value of Cooper Union's full-tuition scholarships for all, they consider it to be just a feature, something that is detachable as a “last resort”. Begrudgingly putting aside philosophy for a minute, President Bharucha's reasoning about a sustainable business model still makes no sense, because as David Gersten, a Professor in the School of Architecture, [articulates][6]:

> It is not that: The Cooper Union holds up free education, but that free education holds up The Cooper Union. It is not that: we can no longer afford to: freely educate, but that we cannot afford to break the promise of Free Education. The largest single financial asset that the Cooper Union currently holds is its promise of free education: TO ALL. The value contained within this promise far exceeds our current endowment as well as the physical properties held by the institution including the land under the Chrysler Building. Our challenge and obligation, our social contract, is to comprehend and make more understandable how to mobilize the resources contained within this promise.

Indeed, it is extraordinary to be providing 1000 educations free of charge in a time where colleges and universities have dumped over [a trillion dollars of debt][7] onto American students. And while raising money for this mission is an extraordinarily complex job, it is not complicated. President Bharucha's unnervingly boilerplate speeches about working together on a sustainable future serve as an admission: he cannot raise the [$400 million][8] it would take to replenish the endowment. He will not. His way is that of the bureaucrat: abhorring hard, simple risk and feeding on measured, micro-managed complication.

Thus, as if to caricature its own distended form, the administration declared an official "[Reinvention][9]" process: Two “task forces” of students, alumni, and faculty were formed to have meetings on a regular basis until they could deliver reports on expense reduction and revenue generation. Two consulting firms were hired indefinitely to hang around running the numbers on various revenue-generating schemes. Chairman Epstein held a [disastrous Q&A Forum][10] in which he told a room full of alumni that he considers them a “failed investment” (a quote which still stings despite a later apology) and he confirmed to a booing crowd that there is no recourse against board decisions. The board hired yet another consultant to answer the question: how can they be a better board. Faculty were given a timespan of a few weeks to come up with revenue-generating programs, and were threatened that if they didn't their respective schools would be shuttered.

By all accounts (except the President's!) the process has been inane, but what is distressing about the Reinvention is its strategy known as “[Responsibility Centered Management][11]”. President Bharucha formally charged the deans of each school with presenting a plan to generate a given amount of revenue per year. The deans in turn passed the task of authoring the form and content of these revenue generating programs to their faculty. Suddenly the Hybrid Model had the whole college spending their nights and weekends drafting specs for a plan that reads like a joke: fund a school that is on principle free by simultaneously operating a very expensive school that does not yet exist. In theory this approach's division of labor ensures that those with the most hands-on knowledge get to contribute to the specifics of planning; in practice, it fails to account for a grave misunderstanding at the root of the charge about the efficacy and ethics of generating revenue from educational programs, while also making the plan politically complicated if not impossible for mid-level administrators and untenured faculty (which is almost everyone) to oppose. In Cooper's case, it also sets back the institution's intellectual pace by distributing the stress and responsibility of revenue generation to faculty who should be focused on teaching students, and deflects blame away from the board for mismanagement by forcefully distributing a pre-determined plan's ownership and authorship. Having the future in one's hands has never, ever been less empowering.

<div class="right" markdown="1">
Even if the Board Chairman and President woke up tomorrow and decided to double-down on the school's promise of free education, have they shown they can handle the money? Sadly, as alumnus and adjunct professor [Kevin Slavin notes][12], the answer is no:

> If someone asked you for $10,000 and had a board of people who were going to spend it, and no one was supervising them — no one! — and they were accountable to no one — no one! — and if you asked, can I find out what you guys are even talking about and they said — no! — and you said, can I even talk to you — and they said — no! — would you invest in that? If it were for profit, would you believe that it would be likely to be profitable? And yet, that’s where we are. Can you imagine a company, in a crisis, that would bar the NYT, Reuters, and the Wall Street Journal from the room — from this room! The Great Hall! — and bring its chairman to address its shareholders who will only answer prepared questions with a lawyer at his side? What is produced in a spectacle like that? What is consumed? What is exhausted? Transparency is not a promise. It’s not an idea. It’s action.

On the brink of collapse, Cooper's administration has vowed to be “transparent”. This means that they [posted some financial documents][13] on the website, started holding office hours, and now walk around beaming as if transparency has been achieved. While these are steps in the right direction, they are not the kind of fundamental change that deeply integrates openness into the institution's governance. For example, when I asked if the administration would keep posting financial documents after the crisis has subsided, Chairman Epstein seemed confused as to why I'd want to keep seeing them. What the administration has been slow to understand is that transparency could be a way of life for this institution and others like it, not just lipgloss on the bloated pig of administration. Slavin is right, changes to the mechanics of Cooper's administration to make it more trustworthy and communicative are the college's first step towards recovery and maybe its only real option.

It has been painful to come to terms with the fact that the past decades of mismanagement are water under the bridge; that we can't undo the mistakes we didn't realize were being made behind closed doors. What we can do is unscrew the doors from their hinges: putting in place systems that foster open, accountable communication and more democratic structures of decision-making. 

While the problem facing Cooper Union is financial, the solution will be political. The problem right now is that some of the actors have changed but the same power structure which got us into this mess has put itself in charge of getting us out. This is what designer Dan Hill calls a “[non-learning system][14]” (Let's not dwell for too long on the irony that institutions of higher education appear to be some of the slowest learners):

There is good failure and bad failure. The former is failure that enables a system to learn, becoming more resilient, more adept. The latter is exhibited within a non-learning system. Are these non-learning systems due to their fundamentally out-of-control characteristics, systems whose complexity has grown beyond our comprehension and capability? Or is it simply that policy is too dislocated from its realisation?

Seeing “bad failure” abound, many have already moved on from higher education as we know it. In a recent essay, [Clay Shirky rightly points out][15] that education today is not worth what students are being charged for it, and that the internet might offer alternatives to going into debt for education. Citing a “cost disease” in higher education, he writes, "institution-specific explanations—spoiled students expecting a climbing wall; management self-aggrandizement at the expense of educational mission—hold up less well than the generic observation: colleges need a lot of highly skilled people, people whose wages, benefits, and support costs have risen faster than inflation for the last thirty years." By establishing a gift economy of higher education, however, Cooper's model addresses part of Shirky's problem. Shirky envisions something between common sense and a compromise: higher education being reduced to something like interactive recorded lectures. Classroom teaching need not be pitted against online courses. As a student, Cooper reminds me every single day that classroom teaching is an expense worth finding somebody besides students to foot the bill for.

While Cooper's administration is larger than it should be, and there is a cost factor there, the problem here is primarily that our administration fails miserably at being swashbuckling advocates for the mission that they've been given. “No one on the inside”, Shirky laments, “has any clear idea about how to change the way our institutions work while leaving our benefits and privileges intact.” And that's exactly where I'd like to pick up. Seeing the Board and President's “Reinvention” process in action over the past year has made it clear that it's not the college, but the college's unwieldy and ineffective administration that will have to be “reinvented” in order to ensure a future for Cooper's model of free education.

Lacking faith in the administration's Hybrid plan, “Reinvention” process, and organizational structures, and feeling like a political problem had generated Cooper's financial problem, I decided to talk to administrators. I was surprised to learn how difficult their jobs are for no apparent reason. After each conversation, I found my mind racing with ideas about how all these people could work better to support the school. It may seem beside the point to nitpick about administrative meetings and job titles in the middle of a financial crisis, but as Slavin noted, this hole was dug “with secrecy and bad information”. Meetings are both the scene of the crime and a wedge we can use to pry Cooper out of its sinkhole. I also sat down to do some research on how administrative bloat affects other colleges and universities, but it practically did itself because, as it turns out, it's [an epidemic][16] threatening every institution in America. It took a little more work to find non-fucked-up examples of administration in action, but I found promising systems in the open source programming community.

It was an administrative song and dance that got us into this mess; and putting in place tools and workflows that enable our leaders to be more accountable and our governance to be more inclusive will get us out. Bureaucracy may default to “bad failure” in times of crisis, but I see an opportunity right now at Cooper Union to build a new administration, as forward-thinking as the college's mission is within today's landscape of higher education. The rest of this essay explores structures, tools, and workflows that would reduce costly administrative overhead, lay solid ground for restoring the trust that is key to Cooper's future as a philanthropically backed institution, and position the college at the forefront of a movement in free classroom teaching.

<h2 id="thats-just-how-it-is">&ldquo;That's Just How It Is.&rdquo;</h2>

<div class="two-col" markdown="1">
Cooper Union's legacy — its mission, financial assets, and eccentric community — are tall shoulders on which to stand, but a long history has costs as well as benefits. Cooper is home to 150 years of institutional cobwebs. We are burdened by politically cloudy flows of information and busted decision-making structures for no reason other than that's how things have always been, or what they eventually amounted to. When I asked Chairman Epstein about his interest in new structures of administration to match the college's radical mission, he [responded curtly][17], “Cooper Union is unique in many ways. Not governance.” The only explanations I can come up with as to why this is are: the difficulty of refactoring a legacy administration, a vested interest in maintaining power, or the fact that old dogs can't be bothered to learn new tricks. If you follow your questions about why our administration works in such confounding ways far enough — just keep asking “Why?” — I can guarantee you will be met with only one answer: that's just how it is. When [a fellow student asked][18] Chairman Epstein why we can't have a student and faculty seat on the board, his response was characteristically unfounded, “That's not how it works...I have a plane to catch”. If we can't find the right combination of administrators and systems to answer up to simple questions such as this, it's going to kill us. That's just how it is.

<h2 id="to-democracy-and-beyond">To Democracy and Beyond</h2>

<div class="two-col" markdown="1">
The bureaucrats at Cooper seem unshakably convinced that their knowledge and power are descended from God, but outside the bubble others are not so sure. Yanis Varoufakis, Chief Economist at Valve Software, is [one such heretic][19]:

> Capitalist corporations are on the way to certain extinction. Replete with hierarchies that are exceedingly wasteful of human talent and energies, intertwined with toxic finance, co-dependent with political structures that are losing democratic legitimacy fast, a form of post-capitalist, decentralised corporation will, sooner or later, emerge. The eradication of distribution and marginal costs, the capacity of producers to have direct access to billions of customers instantaneously, the advances of open source communities and mentalities, all these fascinating developments are bound to turn the autocratic Soviet-like megaliths of today into curiosities that students of political economy, business studies et al will marvel at in the future, just like school children marvel at dinosaur skeletons at the Natural History museum.

We'll return to Valve's corporate structure as an example later, but first take a minute to consider these questions for yourself: If you were to establish a free school in 2012 what would its scaffolding look like? Does the size and shape of higher education administrations across the country right now seem effective? I can hardly imagine how one would even arrive at the stalactites of governance that dominate the higher education landscape today, except by the passage of long spans of time.

Dreams, visions, and plans are all foiled right off the bat by the fact that Cooper Union isn't a democracy. It's not even a public institution, despite the tax benefits it receives from New York City and the citizens it turns back out. Cooper Union is a private not-for-profit institution controlled unequivocally by a volunteer board (meaning they do not draw a salary). An important question to ask is: Who does Cooper Union belong to? A lawyer would probably tell you it's the Board of Trustees, but at the end of the day I, perhaps delusionally, see Cooper Union as belonging to those it was founded to educate: New York City and America's youth, to all the students who have since passed through its doors, and to all the students it has yet to admit. Framed in this way, the last several decades are a scandal in which a self-preserving administration have almost succeeded in stealing one of New York City's jewels.

Cooper Union belongs to each of us, so what should its future look like? While a representative democracy that is principled and non-coercive may sound alluring to Cooper's community, we should consider points of view like the one [presented by Peter Fein][20] at the [2012 Personal Democracy Forum][21]: representative democracy is “government for the age of the horse drawn carriage”. Since we have gotten ourselves into the business of imagining a future administration, we should ask ourselves: what comes next? One place we can take clues from is the world of open source programming.

<h2 id="git-init">> git init</h2>

<div class="two-col" markdown="1">
The invention of the internet connected all types of people to each other, but it was a boon for programmers especially. Before the internet, a programmer's collaborators were limited to those close enough in proximity to walk over and stare at the code on their screen. But now anybody could publish their source code online and get instant feedback from other programmers around the world. Putting these distributed brains in touch meant that software projects had the potential to move faster than ever before. However, this system of writing back and forth was clunky. Programmers needed to get good at self-organizing because of demanding constraints like being separated by thousands of miles while multiple people simultaneously tinker with the same complex and brittle code. Necessity made them invent a better system for how a distributed group of people could stay in the loop about a project's progression and directly participate in building it without stepping on anybody's toes or wasting time on back-and-forth communication. What they came up with is called "[distributed version control][22]", and the most popular manifestation of it today is called Git.

Git knocked down the barrier to collaborating on large, complex software projects without centralized organization. It has proven to be such a successful way of working that, despite his earlier remarks on education, [Clay Shirky predicts][23] that these tools and concepts will shape a new generation of governments. It seems insane that a lot of this could come down to software design, like the program used to write code or draft governance documents (probably Microsoft Word running on a Mac), but these small details and defaults are actually key to understanding flows of information and power within institutions.

For people unfamiliar with the way these tools work, starting to use them opens up whole different mentalities. That's why the best way to start is just to start. In less time than it has taken me to write this essay, I was able to launch a Git powered website for Cooper's [Art Student Council][24], get its twelve members up to speed, and let [the system][25] start taking on a life of its own. Unfortunately, bureaucracy within the upper administration makes it nearly impossible to "just start" doing anything. I hope to break break through into bureaucracy using the sanctioned form of the proposal and ultimately break it down.

<h2 id="wtf-is-a-version-control-system">WTF is a “Version Control System”</h2>

<div class="two-col" markdown="1">
If you've ever saved multiple versions of a file that you're working on (essay.doc, essay-draft.doc, essay-new.doc, essay-new-new.doc) you've basically operated your own manual version control system. Git is like a computerized secretary that keeps track of the history and versions of your files for you in a way that is easier, tidier, and more comprehensive. Once you've turned Git on within a folder you don't need to keep saving differently named versions. Instead, every time you've made a substantive change you "commit" it, telling Git in a sentence what kind of changes you've made. Git stores the original document, your note about what you've changed, and the actual bits that were changed. In a normal workflow you'd end up with a bunch of confusingly named variations of a file (or worse, no versions at all!), but Git allows you to cleanly access a file's history and jump back and forth through changes.

Going the extra step to commit your files makes possible a function called "diffing". A diff is a color coded view of the additions (green) and deletions (red) between any two files or versions of a file. To see what changed last time a file was edited, you could ask Git to show you a diff of the last two versions. If your Git project has a long history you could even ask to see a diff of a file over a span of several years. Because of the descriptive nature of commits, you'd also be shown a record of who made each edit along with their commit message explaining why.

In an administrative context this means that accountability is built in to the system. Every time anybody changes a file managed with Git, the system attaches a record of who, what, when, and why. In a big organization it usually takes some sleuthing to answer these questions. By keeping track of these simple factors Git helps rid information flows and histories of ambiguity.

To illustrate the magic of all this, I put together a demo below that diffs versions of a document from 1972 and 2012.

Because no Git-like system exists within Cooper's administration information is created, disseminated, and archived in a relatively disorganized manner. The amount of work that it took me to put together this example is evidence of the problem: I had to copy-and-paste the most recent version of the bylaws out of a PDF file in which they were posted to Cooper's website, search the internet for an old version of the bylaws (which I was eventually able to find in a different format on a completely different part of the website), manually diff the paragraphs, and then code up a visualization. If our administrators would start using Git-like systems today, the next time the bylaws change a computer would be able to do all of this automatically. If they had started even a year ago, I might've been able to find the entire history of the bylaws just by visiting the document itself. Relatively stable documents like bylaws don't seem to call urgently for accountability, but the necessity of these checks is undeniable when it comes to content like the college's mission statement.

Last year the webpage containing Cooper's mission statement was altered to remove the phrase "full-tuition scholarships." The Cooper community quickly raised a ruckus about its disappearance only to find that the phrase had been quietly restored. It was never made clear who removed the phrase, who added it back in, or where the order to do so came from. Some deny that this incident even happened. The administration's promises to be transparent and accountable fall to pieces when viewed against their systems which allow for anonymous and hasty changes to documents of fundamental importance. The ability to grok changes by looking at diffs and commit logs becomes even more important in situations where information is expected to change constantly.

In response to questions and critiques of the administration's strategy, a Financial FAQ was posted on Cooper's website. I visited the document a few times over the course of a few weeks and found each time that the document been expanded and reorganized without notice. While there is nothing wrong with a living document, it has been unnerving to refer to financial rationalizations that change frequently without any record. To make matters worse the document also has no listed author, aside from residing under the section of the Department of Finance and Administration run by T.C. Westcott. Like with the bylaws, an FAQ isn't the most important piece of information to keep track of, but it represents a systemic, fractal-like lack of accountability.

After hearing what Westcott herself goes through to make sense of all the college's finances I'd imagine she is sympathetic to my concerns. Following attending a financial information session, a fellow student and I carried on our discussion in Westcott's office where she pulled out a big red folder. "This is my 'Where Did The Money Go?' file", she joked. To answer several questions raised in the meeting, we reviewed numbers run this way and that way by different groups of people, but the amount of inferences that were left to be made was shocking. Even with complete access to financial documents and board meeting minutes which the Cooper community at large are not permitted to see, Westcott apparently has to do something akin to forensic accounting. Being careful not to muddy her financial analysis with personal opinion, Westcott admitted that even after you get the numbers to line up it isn't always clear what they indicate. What event does that spike correlate to? Why was a particular choice made at this time? Who authorized this change? When you start using tools and workflows that note who, what, when, and why along with every change, simple questions become immediately answerable and complex ones require much less digging. Using tools which passively generate a comprehensive history solves many problems related to the messy paper trails of bureaucratic administrations, but this is actually just a small part of what Git-like systems have in store.

<h2 id="forks-and-branches">Forks and Branches</h2>

<div class="two-col" markdown="1">
If you remember the acronym for Git-like software: Distributed Version Control Systems, a feature called "forking" represents the D.  In Git-speak, the folder that you put your work in is called your "repository". What makes Git distributed is that anybody can make a copy of your repository onto their own computer to edit as they please. With or without Git anybody can copy anything they want off of the internet onto their computer and change it around, but forking in Git is distinct because Git "clones" the repository in its entirety and keeps those files linked to where they came from. Forking is somewhat self-explanatory in that you are basically creating a fork in the road of that particular repository. One path will continue to be forged by whoever you are copying from (Cooper Union's Administrative Documents), the other by you with your own newly cloned repository (Casey's Administrative Documents). In a similar way to how Git's version control collates the history of changes to a file, Git's forks link different people's versions of a file, allowing you to traverse possibilities. As you can see in the level of abstraction and the shift towards less familiar terminology — repository, fork, clone — this is where Git departs from existing paradigms about how we work. 

Unlike any old copy of a bunch of files, a Git feature called a “pull request” lets you package changes you make on your own computer and submit them back to the original repository’s owner for inclusion. Whether you spot a typo or feel like you need to write your own version of the FAQ with new content and a different tone, Git encourages direct action over indirect feedback. When you submit a pull request, the owners of the repository you forked are presented with a diff of your changes as well as your commit messages describing your intent. If the owners find your changes agreeable, Git can merge your versions automatically (noting in both repositories, of course: who, what, when, and why).

Forks can also be forked, merged, and pulled. For example, you fork the FAQ because you have a better answer to a particular question, and somebody else forks your FAQ to fix a typo. The collaboratively written and copy-edited FAQ can be submitted as a pull request to the owner of the official repository. Even if these systems are only used internally they start to break down barriers to getting work done, but this model becomes especially vibrant when the whole community or the whole world is invited to collaborate. The idea of a potentially unlimited number of forks out there that can be merged back into a repository may seem a little overwhelming and dangerous. Is it wise to let a stranger contribute to a Financial FAQ? Who gets to decide if and when to fold in their changes? That’s where a Git feature called branches comes in. 

Branches are like forks inside of a Git repository. If forks show you everyone’s version of a repository, branches show you ideas that are being worked on within a repository. Looking at the branches of an official repository is a good way to see what’s being worked on and considered within an organization. Using branches well is key to being respectful of community input. If the main branch, called the “master”, is literally the documents and information on which an organization acts, branches can represent drafts of every new idea, upcoming change, or proposed merge from an external fork. By working in branches, and never applying changes to the master before they have been approved by a vote or a test, the community is given time and space to offer feedback on ideas. Using branches as public testbeds might prevent more incidents where the community feels blindsided by administrative decisions that seem to come out of nowhere, h

Just because Git provides a way for everyone to contribute directly doesn’t mean that conversations are unimportant. Git was created in 2005, but has exploded in popularity over the last several years thanks to a “social coding” network called Github. Unlike other networks such as Facebook and Twitter which have more to do with open-ended communication, Github encourages people to move projects forward. This is accomplished in part by building tools for conversation and project management on top of Git’s mechanisms for distributed revision control. These tools run the gamut from starting discussions in a forum, to annotating files line by line, to literally making a change and submitting a pull request. These features shouldn’t be misunderstood to be about obviating face-to-face discussions or working together in real life. By encouraging concrete work over proposals and allowing for more precise feedback, these tools improve meetings and help waste less of everyone’s time.

Using Github to stay in touch, everyone can work asynchronously from wherever on whatever. I employ the word “whatever” specifically to make bureaucrats brains explode, because as it turns out, people can be far more effective and organized outside of micromanaged divisions of labor than we’ve been led to believe. Where bureaucratic structures conjure up images of long meetings under fluorescent lights, Git-like workflows defy any particular image. Maybe the most effective use of your time is copy-editing a sentence, maybe it’s quickly rewriting an entire document. Getting the members of an organization to use tools that make work open, collaborative, and social starts to chip away at how bureaucratic hierarchies inhibit us and waste our time and energy.

You don’t need anybody’s approval to start using Git for yourself, but the more important change will happen when we can re-evaluate the principles and structures of administrations in relation to Git-like mentalities. This is because Git is equal parts tools — commits, diffs, clones, forks, branches, pull requests — and attitudes. You know a crash course in Git has been successful when you hear the loud shattering of a person’s depressing assumptions about how work has to be. 

In an essay published in Daedalus journal, political theorist John Dunn writes how “founding father” James Madison believed that, “Representation would enhance democracy not by rendering it more democratic, but by preventing it from acting hastily, unwisely, and destructively.” Hasty, unwise, and destructive...does that remind you of anything? Reflecting on the past decades at Cooper Union and the current crises at higher educational institutions across America, it is clear that our so-called representative structures of governance have failed us and will continue to if we can’t change them. The tools and mentalities of Git are paving the way for more direct forms of democracy on scales resembling Cooper. Dunn’s only concession to representation is the possibility of, “somnambulistic collective greed or stupidity.” And, as we have seen, it is not collective but autocratic greed and stupidity that has nearly sunken this place. In the words of Clay Shirky, “A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes, in the last decade, in fact. It's large, it's distributed, it's low-cost, and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy. The question for us now is, are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves? Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large?”
