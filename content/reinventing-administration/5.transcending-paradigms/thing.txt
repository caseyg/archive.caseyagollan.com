You don’t need anybody’s approval to start using Git for yourself, but the more important change will happen when we can re-evaluate the principles and structures of administrations in relation to Git-like mentalities. This is because Git is equal parts tools — commits, diffs, clones, forks, branches, pull requests — and attitudes. You know a crash course in Git has been successful when you hear the loud shattering of a person’s depressing assumptions about how work has to be. 

In an essay published in Daedalus journal, political theorist John Dunn writes how “founding father” James Madison believed that, “Representation would enhance democracy not by rendering it more democratic, but by preventing it from acting hastily, unwisely, and destructively.” Hasty, unwise, and destructive...does that remind you of anything? Reflecting on the past decades at Cooper Union and the current crises at higher educational institutions across America, it is clear that our so-called representative structures of governance have failed us and will continue to if we can’t change them. The tools and mentalities of Git are paving the way for more direct forms of democracy on scales resembling Cooper. Dunn’s only concession to representation is the possibility of, “somnambulistic collective greed or stupidity.” And, as we have seen, it is not collective but autocratic greed and stupidity that has nearly sunken this place. In the words of Clay Shirky, “A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes, in the last decade, in fact. It's large, it's distributed, it's low-cost, and it's compatible with the ideals of democracy. The question for us now is, are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves? Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service for society at large?”
