title: WTF Happened at Cooper Union

content:
In June 2009 the [Wall Street Journal reported][1] that one college, Cooper Union, had “sidestepped the crisis”. How was it that colleges and universities across America, some charging their students as much as $60,000 a year in tuition, seemed to be having a hard time paying their bills, while a college that grants a full-tuition scholarship to every single one of its 1000 students had just erected a shiny new building in Manhattan and was floating on a pool of cash? We may never know, because just over two years later in October 2011 Cooper Union's newly appointed President Jamshed Bharucha announced [a very different story][2] to the New York Times: the college is broke and has actually been digging itself into debt for several decades. Because of the positive press in recent years, almost nobody in the Cooper community — students, faculty, staff, alumni, friends, and neighbors — had suspected anything notable was even going on until picking up that copy of the Times. Bharucha's announcement triggered confusion, anger, and an unraveling of messy administrative narratives.

Cooper Union has historically relied on two main sources of money to fund the free education it provides: big-time philanthropists and unconventional real estate deals. Back when the college's board consisted of five members including Andrew Carnegie and J. Pierpont Morgan, the trustees would [allegedly][3] look at the deficit at the end of each year, divide it by five, and each write a check. If the college’s founder Peter Cooper could meet his namesake's board and administration as they exist today he would die all over again out of heartbreak or rage. “There are _how many_ administrators suckling on the endowment? They want to charge students for _what_?” 

In the past several decades, the board has steadily sold off the college's real estate assets to fund increasing, unchecked expenses and fulfill the goals of an expansionist “master plan” (which the trustees [meekly admit][4] “were not achieved as anticipated”). In 2006, for example, they deemed it prudent to take out a $175 million loan to build a shiny new building, putting up the college's most famous asset, the land beneath the Chrysler Building, as collateral. With a portion of the building's costs eventually offset by a capital campaign, the gigantic loan actually went towards keeping the school running in its growth pattern long enough for former President Campbell to retire with his bonus payments intact. In the aftermath of mismanagement — bad strategies executed poorly for decades — the college is left with nothing to sell, a threadbare endowment, a $16 million structural deficit, and an administration that refuses to defend the school's bedrock mission of providing free education based on merit alone.

## The Hybrid Model, or How to Throw 1000 People Under The Bus and Look Good Doing It

President Bharucha issued a [vague mandate][5] that the college must be “reinvented for the 21st century”, but what he was really saying is [this][2]: “Altering our scholarship policy will be only as a last resort, but in order to create a sustainable model, it has to be one of the options on the table.” Or in other words while the administration “gets” the value of Cooper Union's full-tuition scholarships for all, they consider it to be just a feature, something that is detachable as a “last resort”. Begrudgingly putting aside philosophy for a minute, President Bharucha's reasoning about a sustainable business model still makes no sense, because as David Gersten, a Professor in the School of Architecture, [articulates][6]:

> It is not that: The Cooper Union holds up free education, but that free education holds up The Cooper Union. It is not that: we can no longer afford to: freely educate, but that we cannot afford to break the promise of Free Education. The largest single financial asset that the Cooper Union currently holds is its promise of free education: TO ALL. The value contained within this promise far exceeds our current endowment as well as the physical properties held by the institution including the land under the Chrysler Building. Our challenge and obligation, our social contract, is to comprehend and make more understandable how to mobilize the resources contained within this promise.

Indeed, it is extraordinary to be providing 1000 educations free of charge in a time where colleges and universities have dumped over [a trillion dollars of debt][7] onto American students. And while raising money for this mission is an extraordinarily complex job, it is not complicated. President Bharucha's unnervingly boilerplate speeches about working together on a sustainable future serve as an admission: he cannot raise the [$400 million][8] it would take to replenish the endowment. He will not. His way is that of the bureaucrat: abhorring hard, simple risk and feeding on measured, micro-managed complication.

Thus, as if to caricature its own distended form, the administration declared an official "[Reinvention][9]" process: Two “task forces” of students, alumni, and faculty were formed to have meetings on a regular basis until they could deliver reports on expense reduction and revenue generation. Two consulting firms were hired indefinitely to hang around running the numbers on various revenue-generating schemes. Chairman Epstein held a [disastrous Q&A Forum][10] in which he told a room full of alumni that he considers them a “failed investment” (a quote which still stings despite a later apology) and he confirmed to a booing crowd that there is no recourse against board decisions. The board hired yet another consultant to answer the question: how can they be a better board. Faculty were given a timespan of a few weeks to come up with revenue-generating programs, and were threatened that if they didn't their respective schools would be shuttered.

By all accounts (except the President's!) the process has been inane, but what is distressing about the Reinvention is its strategy known as “[Responsibility Centered Management][11]”. President Bharucha formally charged the deans of each school with presenting a plan to generate a given amount of revenue per year. The deans in turn passed the task of authoring the form and content of these revenue generating programs to their faculty. Suddenly the Hybrid Model had the whole college spending their nights and weekends drafting specs for a plan that reads like a joke: fund a school that is on principle free by simultaneously operating a very expensive school that does not yet exist. In theory this approach's division of labor ensures that those with the most hands-on knowledge get to contribute to the specifics of planning; in practice, it fails to account for a grave misunderstanding at the root of the charge about the efficacy and ethics of generating revenue from educational programs, while also making the plan politically complicated if not impossible for mid-level administrators and untenured faculty (which is almost everyone) to oppose. In Cooper's case, it also sets back the institution's intellectual pace by distributing the stress and responsibility of revenue generation to faculty who should be focused on teaching students, and deflects blame away from the board for mismanagement by forcefully distributing a pre-determined plan's ownership and authorship. Having the future in one's hands has never, ever been less empowering.

## Same Shit, Different Decade

Even if the Board Chairman and President woke up tomorrow and decided to double-down on the school's promise of free education, have they shown they can handle the money? Sadly, as alumnus and adjunct professor [Kevin Slavin notes][12], the answer is no:

> If someone asked you for $10,000 and had a board of people who were going to spend it, and no one was supervising them — no one! — and they were accountable to no one — no one! — and if you asked, can I find out what you guys are even talking about and they said — no! — and you said, can I even talk to you — and they said — no! — would you invest in that? If it were for profit, would you believe that it would be likely to be profitable? And yet, that’s where we are. Can you imagine a company, in a crisis, that would bar the NYT, Reuters, and the Wall Street Journal from the room — from this room! The Great Hall! — and bring its chairman to address its shareholders who will only answer prepared questions with a lawyer at his side? What is produced in a spectacle like that? What is consumed? What is exhausted? Transparency is not a promise. It’s not an idea. It’s action.

On the brink of collapse, Cooper's administration has vowed to be “transparent”. This means that they [posted some financial documents][13] on the website, started holding office hours, and now walk around beaming as if transparency has been achieved. While these are steps in the right direction, they are not the kind of fundamental change that deeply integrates openness into the institution's governance. For example, when I asked if the administration would keep posting financial documents after the crisis has subsided, Chairman Epstein seemed confused as to why I'd want to keep seeing them. What the administration has been slow to understand is that transparency could be a way of life for this institution and others like it, not just lipgloss on the bloated pig of administration. Slavin is right, changes to the mechanics of Cooper's administration to make it more trustworthy and communicative are the college's first step towards recovery and maybe its only real option.

It has been painful to come to terms with the fact that the past decades of mismanagement are water under the bridge; that we can't undo the mistakes we didn't realize were being made behind closed doors. What we can do is unscrew the doors from their hinges: putting in place systems that foster open, accountable communication and more democratic structures of decision-making. 

While the problem facing Cooper Union is financial, the solution will be political. The problem right now is that some of the actors have changed but the same power structure which got us into this mess has put itself in charge of getting us out. This is what designer Dan Hill calls a “[non-learning system][14]” (Let's not dwell for too long on the irony that institutions of higher education appear to be some of the slowest learners):

There is good failure and bad failure. The former is failure that enables a system to learn, becoming more resilient, more adept. The latter is exhibited within a non-learning system. Are these non-learning systems due to their fundamentally out-of-control characteristics, systems whose complexity has grown beyond our comprehension and capability? Or is it simply that policy is too dislocated from its realisation?

Seeing “bad failure” abound, many have already moved on from higher education as we know it. In a recent essay, [Clay Shirky rightly points out][15] that education today is not worth what students are being charged for it, and that the internet might offer alternatives to going into debt for education. Citing a “cost disease” in higher education, he writes, "institution-specific explanations—spoiled students expecting a climbing wall; management self-aggrandizement at the expense of educational mission—hold up less well than the generic observation: colleges need a lot of highly skilled people, people whose wages, benefits, and support costs have risen faster than inflation for the last thirty years." By establishing a gift economy of higher education, however, Cooper's model addresses part of Shirky's problem. Shirky envisions something between common sense and a compromise: higher education being reduced to something like interactive recorded lectures. Classroom teaching need not be pitted against online courses. As a student, Cooper reminds me every single day that classroom teaching is an expense worth finding somebody besides students to foot the bill for.

While Cooper's administration is larger than it should be, and there is a cost factor there, the problem here is primarily that our administration fails miserably at being swashbuckling advocates for the mission that they've been given. “No one on the inside”, Shirky laments, “has any clear idea about how to change the way our institutions work while leaving our benefits and privileges intact.” And that's exactly where I'd like to pick up. Seeing the Board and President's “Reinvention” process in action over the past year has made it clear that it's not the college, but the college's unwieldy and ineffective administration that will have to be “reinvented” in order to ensure a future for Cooper's model of free education.

Lacking faith in the administration's Hybrid plan, “Reinvention” process, and organizational structures, and feeling like a political problem had generated Cooper's financial problem, I decided to talk to administrators. I was surprised to learn how difficult their jobs are for no apparent reason. After each conversation, I found my mind racing with ideas about how all these people could work better to support the school. It may seem beside the point to nitpick about administrative meetings and job titles in the middle of a financial crisis, but as Slavin noted, this hole was dug “with secrecy and bad information”. Meetings are both the scene of the crime and a wedge we can use to pry Cooper out of its sinkhole. I also sat down to do some research on how administrative bloat affects other colleges and universities, but it practically did itself because, as it turns out, it's [an epidemic][16] threatening every institution in America. It took a little more work to find non-fucked-up examples of administration in action, but I found promising systems in the open source programming community.

It was an administrative song and dance that got us into this mess; and putting in place tools and workflows that enable our leaders to be more accountable and our governance to be more inclusive will get us out. Bureaucracy may default to “bad failure” in times of crisis, but I see an opportunity right now at Cooper Union to build a new administration, as forward-thinking as the college's mission is within today's landscape of higher education. The rest of this essay explores structures, tools, and workflows that would reduce costly administrative overhead, lay solid ground for restoring the trust that is key to Cooper's future as a philanthropically backed institution, and position the college at the forefront of a movement in free classroom teaching.

## That's Just How It Is.

Cooper Union's legacy — its mission, financial assets, and eccentric community — are tall shoulders on which to stand, but a long history has costs as well as benefits. Cooper is home to 150 years of institutional cobwebs. We are burdened by politically cloudy flows of information and busted decision-making structures for no reason other than that's how things have always been, or what they eventually amounted to. When I asked Chairman Epstein about his interest in new structures of administration to match the college's radical mission, he [responded curtly][17], “Cooper Union is unique in many ways. Not governance.” The only explanations I can come up with as to why this is are: the difficulty of refactoring a legacy administration, a vested interest in maintaining power, or the fact that old dogs can't be bothered to learn new tricks. If you follow your questions about why our administration works in such confounding ways far enough — just keep asking “Why?” — I can guarantee you will be met with only one answer: that's just how it is. When [a fellow student asked][18] Chairman Epstein why we can't have a student and faculty seat on the board, his response was characteristically unfounded, “That's not how it works...I have a plane to catch”. If we can't find the right combination of administrators and systems to answer up to simple questions such as this, it's going to kill us. That's just how it is.

## > git init

The invention of the internet connected all types of people to each other, but it was a boon for programmers especially. Before the internet, a programmer's collaborators were limited to those close enough in proximity to walk over and stare at the code on their screen. But now anybody could publish their source code online and get instant feedback from other programmers around the world. Putting these distributed brains in touch meant that software projects had the potential to move faster than ever before. However, this system of writing back and forth was clunky. Programmers needed to get good at self-organizing because of demanding constraints like being separated by thousands of miles while multiple people simultaneously tinker with the same complex and brittle code. Necessity made them invent a better system for how a distributed group of people could stay in the loop about a project's progression and directly participate in building it without stepping on anybody's toes or wasting time on back-and-forth communication. What they came up with is called "[distributed version control][22]", and the most popular manifestation of it today is called Git.

Git knocked down the barrier to collaborating on large, complex software projects without centralized organization. It has proven to be such a successful way of working that, despite his earlier remarks on education, [Clay Shirky predicts][23] that these tools and concepts will shape a new generation of governments. It seems insane that a lot of this could come down to software design, like the program used to write code or draft governance documents (probably Microsoft Word running on a Mac), but these small details and defaults are actually key to understanding flows of information and power within institutions.

For people unfamiliar with the way these tools work, starting to use them opens up whole different mentalities. That's why the best way to start is just to start. In less time than it has taken me to write this essay, I was able to launch a Git powered website for Cooper's [Art Student Council][24], get its twelve members up to speed, and let [the system][25] start taking on a life of its own. Unfortunately, bureaucracy within the upper administration makes it nearly impossible to "just start" doing anything. I hope to break break through into bureaucracy using the sanctioned form of the proposal and ultimately break it down.
