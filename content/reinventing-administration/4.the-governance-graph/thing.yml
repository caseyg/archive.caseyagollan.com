title: The Governance Graph

Just because Git provides a way for everyone to contribute directly doesn’t mean that conversations are unimportant. Git was created in 2005, but has exploded in popularity over the last several years thanks to a “social coding” network called Github. Unlike other networks such as Facebook and Twitter which have more to do with open-ended communication, Github encourages people to move projects forward. This is accomplished in part by building tools for conversation and project management on top of Git’s mechanisms for distributed revision control. These tools run the gamut from starting discussions in a forum, to annotating files line by line, to literally making a change and submitting a pull request. These features shouldn’t be misunderstood to be about obviating face-to-face discussions or working together in real life. By encouraging concrete work over proposals and allowing for more precise feedback, these tools improve meetings and help waste less of everyone’s time.

Using Github to stay in touch, everyone can work asynchronously from wherever on whatever. I employ the word “whatever” specifically to make bureaucrats brains explode, because as it turns out, people can be far more effective and organized outside of micromanaged divisions of labor than we’ve been led to believe. Where bureaucratic structures conjure up images of long meetings under fluorescent lights, Git-like workflows defy any particular image. Maybe the most effective use of your time is copy-editing a sentence, maybe it’s quickly rewriting an entire document. Getting the members of an organization to use tools that make work open, collaborative, and social starts to chip away at how bureaucratic hierarchies inhibit us and waste our time and energy.
