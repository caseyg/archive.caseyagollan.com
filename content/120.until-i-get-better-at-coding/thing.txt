One day I will read something and feel the hypothetical ecstasy of some awesome information-space tool, the next day I'll look at a stupid infographic, read a story about universal-library vaporware, or see bit of design too clever for its own good and begin to doubt that better tools will make much of a difference. Either way I keep coming back to this desire to look in from outside at swirling systems of thought, to let the public inside a brain in action.

<p>Sometimes I dream about posting long batches of links <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/?p=4602">like Things Magazine</a> does so elegantly / using song lyric dividers / but everything just runs together in my head. <a href="http://dismagazine.com/blog/20226/screens-on-screens-ben-schumacher/">Like pee in a swimming pool</a>. In fact, today I wrote an email and then completely transposed the order of the sentences before hitting send. Some weird form of <a href="http://kottke.org/11/07/a-typeface-for-dyslexics" title="A gravitational typeface for dyslexics by Christian Boer.">dyslexia</a> or <a href="http://awurl.com/ZPILkLAu7" title="Nelson's anxiety about forgetting is complicated by the drugs he takes. For his ADD, Nelson takes Cylert; for his agitation, he takes Prozac; for sleeplessness, he takes Halcion. Halcion can produce aphasia: during our lunch, Nelson sometimes found himself groping for a common word in the middle of a sentence. But for the most part, he was fluent, and he took pleasure in the aptness of his own phrases. Although inconvenienced by his disorder, Nelson is nonetheless proud of it. &quot;Attention Deficit Disorder was coined by regularity chauvinists,&quot; he remarked. &quot;Regularity chauvinists are people who insist that you have got to do the same thing every time, every day, which drives some of us nuts. Attention Deficit Disorder - we need a more positive term for that. Hummingbird mind, I should think.&quot; Xanadu, the ultimate hypertext information system, began as Ted Nelson's quest for personal liberation. The inventor's hummingbird mind and his inability to keep track of anything left him relatively helpless. He wanted to be a writer and a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. His great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing. To this concept of branching, nonlinear writing, Nelson gave the name hypertext.">hummingbird mind</a>.</p>

<p>I could reshuffle these links until I forget the way I was trying to fit them together. And until I GET BETTER AT CODING there will be no four-dimensional node based constellation of ideas that spins around, so text will have to suffice. There will be no transposition of this either, if I can help it. I&#8217;m smashing these things into place asfastaspossible and hitting <code>Create Post ✓</code>.</p>

<p>This is a draft. Maybe I will take it down after I get the victory thrill of posting it. Or some day it will get edited.</p>

<hr><p>For at least the past couple of years, my reccuring daydream has been interacting with constellations of thoughts and references in some sort of <a href="http://awurl.com/BBvtWPBx3">hypermedia</a> space: <a href="http://arborjs.org/">nodes</a>, <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/journal/view/217">spheres</a>, facets. The <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/5579">Snarkmarket</a> guys and <a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/6984494439">Frank Chimero</a> are also on to this. One day I will read something and feel the hypothetical ecstasy of some awesome information-space tool, the next day I&#8217;ll look at a stupid infographic, read <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html">a story about universal-library vaporware</a>, or see bit of design too clever for its own good and begin to doubt that better tools will make much of a difference. Either way I keep coming back to this desire to look in from outside at swirling systems of thought, to let the public inside a brain in action.</p>

<p>A beacon of design optimism for me lately has been the work of <a href="http://samizdat.cc">Christian Swinehart</a>. He&#8217;s a designer who codes with a background in neuroscience. I&#8217;ve been digging into his RISD MFA thesis, a little book called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/pattern-recognition/3148356"><em>Pattern Recognition</em></a>. This bit about the linearity of language versus the grok-ability of visual systems just <em>gets me</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through a degree of parallelism seen few other places in nature, the brain is able to process huge amounts of sensory information in real time and without our having to expend any mental effort. Yet the irony of our conscious experience is the linear character our thoughts take on when we express ourselves using words.</p>
  
  <p>Despite the primacy of language in constructing ideas and models of the world around us, there are places where our parallel nature peeks through and this seriality of thought is exposed for the façade that it is. Perhaps the most vivid is the ability of our visual system to process diagrams containing hundreds of data points in a single glance and immediately see patterns that would elude us when confronted with an equivalent table of figures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a refreshingly un-Tufte-an lack of pretension Swinehart cites <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/upload/2006/11/digging2.jpg">Richard Scarry&#8217;s book <em>What Do People Do All Day?</em></a> as having some of the earliest graphics he interpreted, and still some of the best. (&#8220;It speaks in formal terms its audience will embrace (fuzzy animals), has a structure that rewards investigation at multiple zoom levels, and leaves you with an understanding of both the parts and the system as a whole.&#8221;) What Swinehart is pointing out is that Scarry&#8217;s graphics are <strong>highly synthesized</strong> for presentation to a specific audience: kids.</p>

<p>All organization is a form of synthesis. Computers are <em>terrible</em> just terrible at it—even the most basic kinds of synthesis performed easily by humans. Maybe I&#8217;m making this up but it has something to do with the parallelism Swinehart talks about. Even Google&#8217;s creepy post-human singularity-style indexing and ranking—which is pretty damn good at synthesizing which pages are important—is based on code written by humans. Until we can create machines that go beyond self-replication into self-invention, we must teach the machines that we want to replace us. As Kevin Slavin notes in his talk <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world.html">How Algorithms Shape Our World</a>, it gets scary (and interesting?) when we stop being able to read the output of the code we write. Then things happen like a financial meltdown caused by wacky trading between autonomous <em>non-human</em> computer systems.</p>

<p>In my hypothetical brain constellation, the ground shifts too fast for a foundation of human synthesis to make sense. A computer, with its strengths and weaknesses will have to be responsible for drawing the map. I absolutely imagine that these brain-contellations will be regularly edited and moderated by humans, but even if I were to employ my own brain-librarian (another strange dream of mine) they would still not be able to work fast enough to index everything and tie it together by hand.</p>

<p>Today I stumbled across this paraphrasing of <a href="http://www.1972municholympics.co.uk/">Otl Aicher</a> that I had saved on my computer a few months ago, &#8220;a designer is a kind of moralist whose activity consists of evaluation and whose task is to create order in a conflict-field of heterogeneous factors.&#8221; It&#8217;s not easy. It reminded me why I&#8217;ve been turning <a href="http://adamflorin.com/work/e-flux-journal-layout-generator">Adam Florin&#8217;s e-flux layout generator</a> over in my mind, not because it&#8217;s particularly complicated, but the idea of automated design is fascinating.</p>

<p>I started but didn&#8217;t finish Marvin Minsky&#8217;s awesome/frightening/dubious book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind">The Society of Mind</a> earlier in the year that also attempts to break abstract actions like laying out a page into smaller and smaller sub-processes. At a certain level of granularity, maybe it starts to become believable that we&#8217;re just simple systems of great scale. Fractal-like.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m 62% through James Gleick&#8217;s book <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/chaos-making-new-science-ebook/B000AJYVB0/B004Q3RRPI">Chaos: Making a New Science</a>, which is like the hardcore-nerdy scientific cousin of some of these whispy abstract thoughts. I&#8217;d been wanting to read Gleick&#8217;s book The Information, but then one day Chaos was on sale in the Kindle store for $3. Humans are rational like that. Sometimes it gets a little heavily into math and either my eyes start to glaze over or I start wishing (not really) that I had followed a different life path and become a Computer Science major. It&#8217;s well written. There are nice pictures. I like to read about the quirks of scientists, &#8220;Even Feigenbaum’s friends were wondering whether he was ever going to produce any work of his own&#8230;he did not seem interested in devoting his own research to any problem that might pay off. &#8221; Also, the horrendous politics of the scientific community put the art world and office politics to shame.</p>

<p>Another nice part of having a Kindle: <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> on the beach. It&#8217;s a revelation that has me wondering, as somebody who hates eye-tiring screen-reading but loves things for the screen, why I waited so long. It also caused me to start more actively differentiating between <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/">formless and definite texts</a>.  I&#8217;m now collecting things which are either <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:caseygollan/t:to-read">too good or difficult in their screen-presentation to be converted into plaintext</a>. Printed books I read about online go in that bucket too. <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/all/1">This Wired story</a> looks particularly nice. So does <a href="http://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/9/mao__king_kong__and_the_future_of_the_book">Triplecanopy</a>.</p>

<p>A weird part of using a Kindle is seeing exactly what percentage you&#8217;re at in a text (62%?!) as the primary indicator of position. The percentages are a little misleading because nobody (I hope) reads through all the end notes and random crap in most books, which can account for a good portion.  iBooks in contrast shows an unchanging image of stacked pages, surely just to infuriate anti-skeuomorphs. In his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/5">epic review of Mac OS X Lion</a>  John Siracusa railed against the skeuomorphism prevalent in Apple&#8217;s latest update, writing, &#8220;These graphics are writing checks this interface can&#8217;t cash.&#8221; Good line.</p>

<p>All this app developers getting sued over software patents bullshit that&#8217;s been going around reminds me of a line from <em>Chaos</em>: &#8220;It was a legitimate question. If one scientist announces that a thing is probably true, and another demonstrates it with rigor, which one has done more to advance science? Is the making of a conjecture an act of discovery? Or is it just a cold-blooded staking of a claim?&#8221; Gleick is talking about how tensions can crop up between between immaterial theorists and rigorous experimenters in science, I like the phrase &#8220;cold-blooded staking of a claim,&#8221; though, applied to patent trolls. For example, Amazon has patented &#8220;one click&#8221; checkout as a &#8220;business process,&#8221; meaning competitors like Barnes and Noble actually have to make people click twice. How is the patent system helping foster innovation, again?? Not to mention the &#8220;patent incubator&#8221; companies that exist purely to patent ideas and then run after anybody who uses them for license fees. Terrifying.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember exactly how I stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.06/patents_pr.html">June 2006 Wired article by Evan Ratliff</a> on independent patent-buster Greg Aharonian, but it&#8217;s awesome. Aharonian isn&#8217;t a lawyer, he&#8217;s a programmer who built and started maintaining his own private database of software, something which is generally poorly cataloged. &#8220;For the buck-fifty it cost to get a copy of the patent, you could get a listing of a lot of source code, and it was quite valuable,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;So I started tracking that and just added it to my database. But I really wasn&#8217;t paying much attention to the patents.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t really have any success selling the software catalog to anyone until software patent litigation started heating up. Then he found himself sitting on an invaluable database of &#8220;prior art&#8221; used to invalidate dubious patents. As its creator, Aharonian surely has an intimate knowledge of the shape of the information in his database. Ratliff even attributes Aharonian&#8217;s sucess to, &#8220;his own software expertise and renowned searching capabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Artist Harm van den Dorpel (I like this page from his old site of <a href="http://harmvandendorpel.com/first">supposed firsts of mechanically reproducible media</a>) tweeted that he has <a href="http://harmvandendorpel.com/">a new website that&#8217;s &#8220;a non-linear relational/associative network.&#8221;</a>. As it turns out, there is no navigation besides viewing one main text, image, or video (called an &#8220;association&#8221;) and then navigating to another by clicking a thumbnail or excerpt. Each association presents slightly different related thumbnnails.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s something that I wrote about it one night as I was falling asleep in my notebook: &#8220;I have crazy dreams about working with ideas using node-based software. As far as I no [sic], nothing good exists yet, but my interest is piqued every time I come across non-conventional ways of interacting with information.</p>

<p>Familiarity is a huge factor in reducing frustration. I found that I was basically unable to use Holmberg&#8217;s [sic] website because there was no way to gauge the shape of its content, like looking through a box of clippings with a flashlight, or walking through a gallery with blinders on, only more intelligent because there is literally no ground, the entire world is shifting based on some secret relevance every time you navigate to a new item.</p>

<p>Maybe we need more opinionated interfaces. We are conditioned by Google and iTunes to treat every interface like a machine designed to give us something we want, and if it does not it is broken. Don Norman on desire lines. Need to be better about writing in full sentences.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that point I think I passed out and woke up with a new area of ink splotches on my sheets from where I fell asleep before capping the pen. Based on the blotches, it&#8217;s the second time that&#8217;s happened.</p>

<p>I had clicked around for a while and felt kind frustrated because I found myself going in small loops through what was obviously a large dataset. I looked at the URL structure, for example:</p>

<p><code><a href="http://harmvandendorpel.com/associations/559">http://harmvandendorpel.com/associations/559</a></code></p>

<p>and started paging through the items numerically. The three-digit number beginning with five was a clue that this is a large collection (it appears to contain just under 600 items). Occasionally an ID, such as <code>/1</code> brought me to a broken page. Working upwards through the associations, it appeared that each item was in a relatively similar grouping to those before and after it, but every couple digits I would see a shift entirely in the related items. What is amazing to me is how an incredibly simple system (as I  suspect this is, but cannot quite put a finger on it) can be completely opaque to outsiders. Minsky writes about a similar idea in The Society of Mind, &#8220;When you accelerate your car by pressing on the gas pedal, this is not what does the work; it is merely a signal to make the engine push the car. Similarly, rotating the steering wheel is merely a signal that makes the steering mechanism turn the car.&#8221; In this case, clicking the thumbnails is not what does the associative work, and I don&#8217;t need to see the underlying web of connections between associations to move between them.  Though I do find it frustrating to have that map withheld.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/harmvddorpel/status/70900846526857216">a tweet</a> Van den Dorpel writes, &#8220;Where in the past storing something in an archive meant its death, contemporary archival aesthetics invoke life instead.&#8221; For traditional intents and purposes: looking for information about the artist and his work, the website is dysfunctional—or at least non-traditionally-functional. It provides only a way to get lost-er, though that would seem to be the artist&#8217;s intent.</p>

<p>This issue of opacity is why even if it were possible for me to comprehensively map out nodes and links between thoughts in a 1:1 way, it might not be that interesting to let the public into that system. Somewhere between Aharonian, who can make a racket and a living off of his aptitude at searching his private patent database, and the un-synthesized, out of grasp relational simplicity of Van den Dorpel&#8217;s non-linear archive is the work of Christian Swinehart.</p>

<p>His work, which he details in Pattern Recognition, leverages design not in the sense of making things pretty but as a method of synthesizing patterns and systems into something more understandable. In Chaos, Gleick quotes physicist Robert Shaw quoting historian Thomas Kuhn, &#8220;You don’t see something until you have the right metaphor to let you perceive it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Combining brute force and elegance, Swinehart visualizes the hell out of systems which, similar to Van den Dorpel&#8217;s site, have blinders built into their default usage. His best known project, which was my initial point of entry into his work, is <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/">a visualization of the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books</a> of the 80&#8217;s. Each of the books is visualized as raw choice data, a diagram simultaneously showing all possible paths, and a decision tree. Several of the diagrams are also presented in animated form and one of the books is &#8220;playable&#8221; online. In plotting every possible option on the same canvas, Swinehart reduces the seemingly boundless interactivity of the CYOA books to finite maps. Browsing abstractions of the books and reading <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/">Swinehart&#8217;s findings about their structure</a> is a totally different experience than actually traversing the books themselves. And like the Misnky passage above, you don&#8217;t need to understand the structural arc of the book to use it and have it work for you as entertainment, but there is something profound in understanding the system of each book and the series as a whole. In going outside sanctioned form of navigation, Swinehart also uncovered an easter egg: an isolated ending unreachable by following directions. It seems as if the series was just waiting for somebody like Swinehart to come along and crack it. Achievment unlocked!</p>

<p>In providing a playable book, a visual dissection of the system, and a thorough, eloquent piece of writing about the project, Swinehart covers many bases from game design, to information design, to journalism. The authors of <a href="http://newsgames.gatech.edu/">Newsgames: Journalism at Play</a> write, &#8220;Videogames offer a new model for infographics, one that might combine the analytical sophistication of Playfair&#8217;s and Maynard&#8217;s early infographics with the emotional context of later approaches.&#8221; They seem to suggest that the most potent experiences that will come out of work at the intersection of these areas will be the result of finding a way to unify the aspects which are usually left distinct, as in Swinehart&#8217;s project. However, they are quick to admit the problem that presents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good games depict system dynamics rather than narrating specific accounts&#8230;Some of the subtleties that make the system rich (and make the article fascinating) are lost in the game-a situation probably attributable to the designers&#8217; desire to make the game manageable, learnable, and playable in short sessions. Nevertheless, the article provides only a disconnected, mathematical account&#8230;while the game offers a synthetic experience of the practice, one that unifies the disconnected algorithms of the print piece into a holistic account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Swinehart&#8217;s playable book actually includes not just the original &#8220;game&#8221; but one of his path visualizations which updates as you navigate the text, thoughtfully integrating the primary-document and its analysis. It seems, however, like games might have something more to teach design.</p>

<p>Minsky writes that, &#8220;players of computer games use symbols to invoke the processes inside their complicated game machines without the slightest understanding of how they work.&#8221; But could games also be used to move players away from their reliance on the interface? To teach them about the systems beneath the symbols? When games stop modeling reality and veer into fiction or invention, they must find ways of helping the player understand the laws of the game space. Games go to great lengths with printed or digital manuals and interactive tutorials designed to familiarize the user with the game world. But interface design typically provides no clues, even when the rules have changed.</p>

<p>If Van den Dorpel&#8217;s non-linear relational archive is imagined as it could exist in physical space it would work like this: from a curtain behind which hundreds of objects are stored, one object is brought out and placed on a stage, flanked by photographs of several related objects. If you point to a related object photograph, the object is brought onto the stage and all the photographs in front of the curtain are re-evaluated for their relevance to the new main object. The irrelevant photos are sent back behind the curtain, replaced in the foreground by new relevant ones. While this system <em>works</em> in real life, it is not fast, efficient or practical in the ways virtual space and relational databases afford.</p>

<p>To allow the user of the physical archive to ask questions of the assistants shuffling objects and images back and forth, for example, &#8220;how do you choose the relevant items?&#8221; would quickly reveal the system&#8217;s inner workings. The other option would be to brute force the system, requesting each object in numerical order. Perhaps with Van den Dorpel&#8217;s archive, the intent is to direct the users to a specific experience or understanding without revealing the system&#8217;s coarse logic. But Swinehart&#8217;s method of reverse-engineering: working outside of the suggested navigation, taking thorough notes, and charting the results, presents an alternative kind of understanding.</p>
