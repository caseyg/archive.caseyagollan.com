Picking up where [Bridle](http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/news/this-is-a-working-shop) left off,

> "But this is precisely what we cannot do with notional objects, software, code: we cannot linger before them. But can we imagine a way to do so?

> I’m going to code things to make code more visible, I’m going to print it out, project it, talk about it and interrogate it. And I’m going to do the same with ideas about craft and working with your hands. I’m not sure exactly where it’s going to go, but I’ll report back."

God I love this, but then there's the picture above of part of this project's instantiation. And it just set me off NO NO NO I don't want to linger in front of screens or projectors. Please god no. I _know_ I already do, but.

There is a thread on Metafilter that I can't find anymore where everyone is trying to guess what will be totally unethical in a hundred years. For example: domesticated pets. Who puts their dog on a pole…like a stripper!

There were some other good things, but here is my guess: in 100 years light-emitting screens will be considered unethical! dangerous! downright stupid! 

They have to change, they just have to. They will look back and laugh or maybe cry. 

Who wants to spend time around screens? They're basically radioactive. This is stupid but I've come to feel this weird completely made up kinship with Marie Curie who I don't even know that much about except that she spent her days handling tubes of shit that poisoned her by osmosis, right?

Screens are so terrible that I'm convinced they've basically fueled this whole fucking Brooklyn Axe™ thing for the creative class that spends all day on their iMacs. I can't get into it right now because I'll lose my shit but this is a normal axe, you know, you buy it at a hardware store and it cuts things:

And this is a brooklyn axe. From the Summer Time 2009 collection ugh so five minutes ago!

You twirl it over your back and please make sure the blade is covered with its BESPOKE leather coozy so like no trees get hurt.

I live in brooklyn and can attest to the fact that I have no use for either of these things. But the brooklyn axe is suffused with this romance slash primal fantasy about going into work and fucking up your iMac with its antithesis. Or more likely just hanging upstate, in plaid. BUT THIS IS BESIDES THE POINT FUCK.

I used to come home from the office dreading looking at a screen for another second. But knowing that it's the only link to this crazy world.

Screens are spectacle, still. In public spaces you walk past screens and they ripple with their stupid lag to show that they're not just stickers.

Did you know you can browse the web on your Kindle? It works all around the world for free (which is so weird and unexpected) but more importantly it looks like nothing you've ever seen before to pull up Facebook through the lens of e-ink. I mean, it's a totally lame way to look at what's on screens: sans color, strobe-y refresh, slow and glitchy, a lacking contrast. But it's a revelation to not be shot in the face with light while reading.

I was on the beach a few days ago and there was this really unhappy woman near by who seemed like she was like getting a divorce from her husband from the way they were interacting, and everyone went to play in the water but she stayed on her towel squinting at her iPad in the glaring sun. And I kept looking over by accident when they were fighting, and then like staring really hard when I realized she was attempting to use an iPad in direct sunlight.

I broke my Kindle screen and never got a replacement and maybe that's why I have this pent up anger about being chained to a screen in Summer Time 2012. It REALLY REALLY doesn't work like this with the smiling. Sad people try to look at iPads in direct sunlight.

Screens and projectors are points of contention amongst artists working in computer world. How do you show art on computers in museums and galleries? Maybe this isn't a problem but a symptom of a larger problem.

When I saw this show in the MoMA a few months ago it struck me for the first time that screens are soooo particular. Perhaps so 2012. It took until this setting, I think, to realize that screens are formal: intimate, glowing, radiating, private, tiring, electrifying, familiar, harsh, luminous.

I don't know how the future will work precisely. But looking at screens in shady places aaaaallllll the fuuckkkinnggg tiiiiiimeeeee isn't the way things have to be, it's just the way things are. I don't want to feel like I have to choose. In a hundred years people won't.
