I wonder what airplanes were like before screens. I ask mom. She reminds me that before there were endless rows of screens—

the plane goes on and on it is three years old and has two whole floors passing through curtain after curtain into deeper realms of Economy traffic jams caused by impassable beverage carts it took us twenty minutes to travel from the front to the back

—there were just less screens. Oh yeah. Like taking the bus except with those two prong headphones that the airlines must've also realized make no sense because I haven't seen them in years. And barf bags.

Also they would bring you personal DVD players, like it was a present, if you were flying nice.

Or you could close your eyes.

Now everyone has their personal screen in the back of the seat in front of them.

I wonder when buses will have them too. The economics probably don’t make sense. 

I wonder if customer satisfaction increased dramatically after ubiquitous screens everyone melting.

In the first five minutes after sitting down, the lady in front of us lifts herself up and turns around to let Niki know she has been kicking the lady's daughter’s seat. This made me a little scared of using the screen, because every time I would touch an onscreen button and the screen wouldn't respond and I'd have to touch it again and again or touch it harder and then try maybe holding it for a second or then counting to five or double tapping (to no avail) I would imagine the lady lifting and turning and asking me to stop tapping the lady's daughter’s seat. I would have to explain also indignantly that the screen is kind of broken sorry and the person behind me is doing the same thing to me and she’s probably doing it to the person in front of her sorry.
