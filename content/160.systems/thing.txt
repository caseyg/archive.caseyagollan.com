excerpt: Part of the reason systems are hard to see is because they're an abstraction. They don't really exist until you articulate them. And any two things don't make a system, even where there are strong correlations. Towns with more trees have lower divorce rates, for example, but you'd be hard-pressed to go anywhere with that. However, if you can manage to divine the secret connections and interdependencies between things, it's like putting on glasses for the first time.
