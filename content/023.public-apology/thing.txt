excerpt: We're all guilty of petty little crimes and it's time we own up. It’s the little things we do that ruin it for everyone else: clipping our nails in public, throwing our gum on the ground, or yelling at a waiter in a restaurant. By placing memorials to our mistakes in the places where we made them, we can publicly apologize for our actions and make sure that nobody repeats them. The public apology form serves to publicly embarrass the person who committed the misdemeanor, and also redeem them by helping others to not make the same mistake in the same place.
