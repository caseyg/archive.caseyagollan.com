I don’t sketch all the time. So, as an artist, what do I do in my spare time?  

- Think about things but let the thoughts pass rather than recording them,  
- Get lost in concepts that I can’t make real,  
- Voraciously consume books, magazines, and websites,  
- Have conversations with people about art and life and whatever,  
- Eat, sleep and or nap,  
- Hug my dog, Miko,  
- Design & edit a newspaper and art/literary magazine,  
- Sometimes write in a notebook,  
- Sometimes play a computer game,  
- Not sketch.  
- I have fumbled with numerous notebooks, sketchbooks, diaries, blogs, whatever.  
- I know that keeping a sketchbook helps me to collect my visual thoughts and trace their evolution, and I enjoy finding the roots of an idea. - A good sketchbook can help me find out where an idea came from. A good sketchbook can show me how I develop. To show this, a good sketchbook needs to be consistent.  
- I find it hard to be consistent without some kind of system. In seventeen years, I have almost never kept a good notebook/sketchbook.  
- But that’s okay, because it takes alot of fumbling without a good system to figure out how a system should function.  
- I enjoy creating and collaborating with systems. This is a new system, I will fill the same sheet out every day. Sometimes, at the end of the day, I won’t have anything interesting to say. And on certain days I won’t want to do this at all.  
- But, I will do it every day, and worst case, if I forget or fall asleep or there is an earthquake, I will have to complete two sheets the next day.  
- And so the parameters are set, let the sketching begin. The next sheet is a blank example of the form which I am to fill out every day.
