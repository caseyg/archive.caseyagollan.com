While staying true to Louis's intensely stark mockups, we arrived at a better reading experience and managed to make a ton of subtle, under-the-hood improvements to the site's functionality. The site's homepage bares a list of everything ever published by Pool, with visited links shown in gray. This allows readers to leave and return to the site and remember what is left to be explored.",

However, if you can manage to divine the secret connections and interdependencies between things, it's like putting on glasses for the first time.”",

There are also the criticisms: some vehemently oppose any computer interface with a torn paper edge and others are trying to invent less dated replacements for the “save” icon (which is still commonly represented by a floppy disk).",

What if instead of dealing with our glut of information by erasing it, we came up with ways to deprecate our past, update our present and make sure that our digital histories are preserved for the future? I think that somewhere between writing, remixing and reblogging, between editing a wiki and branching code on a project in Git, is a new model for existing online.",
