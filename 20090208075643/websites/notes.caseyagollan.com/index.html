		<p>I was <strong>extremely</strong> fortunate to attend a local simulcast of the TED Conference today, and it was incredible, I had such a great time! Here are a few words about each TED Talk I watched today.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Session 8: Discover</h3>

<p><strong>Thelma Golden</strong> <em>Curator of the Harlem Studio Museum</em></p>

<p>Made me feel good about museums. How can a museum revitalize a neighborhood? Museums need to be turned over to artists to show how they work, curation creates conversations between pieces and provokes thoughts in the viewer. Telling stories through the work of others.</p>

<p><strong>Jennifer Mather</strong> <em>Psychologist</em></p>

<p>Made a case for octopus intelligence. Defined intelligence, 3 Ps: personality, play, [I forget the third one]. Mom: &#8220;I feel bad that we have one in the freezer.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Nalini Nadkarni</strong> <em>Tree Researcher</em></p>

<p>Preserving forests is important! People don&#8217;t really care. Marketing to a young demographic by sending out &#8220;Tree Researcher Barbie.&#8221; Engages prisoners in time-consuming work restoring mosses. They love it, it requires no sharp tools, and it benefits the environment. Brilliant.</p>

<p><strong>Bonnie Bassler</strong> <em>Molecular Biologist</em></p>

<p>I thought I had no interest in bacteria, other than the fact that it grosses me out. Turns out bacteria is actually good for you and necessary. Bacteria speaks in a chemical language both within its species and with all bacteria. We are running out of antibiotics, but by understanding how bacteria interact we can, using similarly shaped synthetic receptors, block the feedback loop that causes them to grow. We can also stimulate positive bacteria, &#8220;make their conversations better.&#8221; Absolutely TERRIFIC presenter. Great use of powerpoint to make herself understood.</p>

<p><strong>Nathan Wolfe</strong></p>

<p>Wolfe is tracking the spread of diseases from animals to humans by collecting blood samples in the jungle. Fascinating.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Session 9: Grow</h3>

<p><strong>Natasha Tsakos</strong></p>

<p>WOW. What an amazing presentation, I want to see her performance. Interested in the intersection of technology and performance. Kinda like a mime that performs perfectly alongside music, sound effects, and 3D projections. Absolutely stunning and captivating. Fun to watch! I wish her good luck with her Zero character.</p>

<p><strong>Rosamund Zander</strong> <em>Therapist and Coach</em></p>

<p>LOVE the chair. &#8220;I feel so much more secure in my chair.&#8221; LOVE LOVE LOVE her manual for adult life! &#8220;Nobody wrote it, so I decided to start it.&#8221; Brilliant.</p>

<p><strong>Dickson Despommier</strong></p>

<p>Thinks high-rise hydroponic farming will save the world. Beautiful renderings. He seems slightly off his rocker. Something didn&#8217;t sit right with me about his plan.</p>

<p><strong>Willie Smits</strong></p>

<p>Not only presented the most comprehensive, working plan to create sustainable economies that respect the environment that I&#8217;ve ever heard, but accomplished it in the most unforgiving area in the world AND he controls weather! Is there anything he didn&#8217;t think of? A true genius.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Session 10: Dare</h3>

<p><strong>Capacitor</strong></p>

<p>Reminded of Artists in Action class from this summer with the amazing Judy. These dancers/acrobats moved slowly to strange music on beautiful, kinetic, sculptural supports. Collaborating with a system. Limiting yourself to movement inside a shape or system can force you to move in ways you never expected.</p>

<p><strong>Ray Zahab</strong></p>

<p>I must&#8217;ve been in the bathroom for this one?</p>

<p><strong>Mary Roach</strong></p>

<p>Author of Stiff. Talked about the science behind orgasms. Except not really science, more like funny stuff. Funniest talk of the day, had me cracking up. I want to read her book, she&#8217;s a riot. Answered the question: can legally dead people have orgasms? (yes)</p>

<p><strong>Lena Maria Klingvall</strong></p>

<p>Born with no arms and one deformed leg. Doesn&#8217;t ask for sympathy. Loves her disability. Does everything with her feet and mouth. Extremely capable. Happy! Great parents. Great personality. Inspiring and not cheezy. Great handwriting with her foot!</p>

<p><strong>Ueli Gegenschatz</strong></p>

<p>THE DUDE IN THE WINGSUIT VIDEO ON YOUTUBE. OMG. So funny and exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Herbie Hancock</strong></p>

<p>Feeling the music! Awesome bassist.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Other Things</h3>

<p><strong>Chris Anderson</strong></p>

<p>Was really boring, uncharismatic, and occasionally rude. I really appreciate the work he does putting TED together, but it doesn&#8217;t make him a good MC. Next year, replace him with June Cohen, his #2 who has the biggest smile in the world!</p>

<p><strong>Evan Williams</strong> <em>CEO of Twitter</em></p>

<p>Had some interesting things to say about Twitter. I am warming up to the service. I follow John Maeda, Jenny Holzer, and the historical line-by-line diary I posted about a few days ago. Still no biz model? Getting worried!!</p>

<p><strong>Eric Lewis</strong></p>

<p>Gave a RAPTUROUS piano performance. He looked possessed. IN-CRED-I-BLE. Made me think of The Gift/Whitman.</p>

<p><strong>New TED.com</strong></p>

<p>Cool new feature with translation into many uncommon languages and searchable interactive transcripts. They are doing good things.</p>

<p><strong>Ben Zander &amp; Imogen Heap @ Pop!Tech</strong></p>

<p>Watched two talks after TED from Pop!Tech by Ben Zander (Husband of Rosamund Zander) he gave a cello lesson to his student in front of the audience. He&#8217;s an amazing teacher/person. Imogen heap did improv/jammed with herself through loops.</p>

<p><strong>The Food, The Dogs, The Hosts, The People</strong></p>

<p>All amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>

		<h3><p>Baffled city investigators began calling them “maple syrup events”: mysterious waves of sweet-smelling air that periodically wafted over Manhattan, delighting some, troubling others and vanishing as quickly as they had arrived.</p>

<p>The city revealed on Thursday that the culprit was the seeds of fenugreek, a cloverlike plant, which are used to produce fragrances at a factory across the Hudson River in North Bergen, N.J. It turned out that the city had never given up trying to determine the aroma’s origin. It had quietly created a crack maple-syrup team that remained on the case.</p>

<p>The North Bergen factory, owned by a company called Frutarom, used the herbal seeds to manufacture food flavors, releasing a pungent, generally pleasant smell in the process. Under the right weather conditions — high humidity, no rain — the aroma drifts across the Hudson onto the West Side of Manhattan.</p>

<p>“I think it’s safe to say that the mystery of the maple syrup mist has been solved,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference at City Hall, cautioning that the city was still investigating several leads.</p></h3>

		<p><a href="http://annesherwoodpundyk.blogspot.com/2009/01/walter-benjamin-snack.html" target="_blank">Anne Sherwood Pundyk: Walter Benjamin Snack:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Written in 1935,  by Walter  Benjamin, &#8220;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,&#8221; contains the following paragraph notable for its relevance to the current state of the Internet and for its coherence:</p>
  
  <p>&#8220;For centuries a small number of writers were confronted by many thousands of readers.  This changed toward the end of the last century.  With the increasing extension of the press, which kept placing new political, religious, scientific, professional, and local organs before the readers, an increasing number of readers became writers &#8212;at first, occasional ones.  It began with the daily press opening to its readers space for &#8220;letters to the editor.&#8221;  And today there is hardly a gainfully employed European who could not, in principle, find an opportunity to publish somewhere or other comments on his work, grievances, documentary reports, or that sort of thing.  Thus, the distinction between author and public is about to lose its basic character.  The difference becomes merely functional; it may vary from case to case.  At any moment the reader is ready to turn into a writer.  As expert, which he had to become willy-nilly in an extremely specialized work process, even if only in some minor respect, the reader gains access to authorship.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of my favorite quotes is “Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.” by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Liebling" target="_blank">A. J. Liebling</a></p>

<p>The internet is a total free-for-all, but there is definitely a difference in authority between being published on the internet, being published at the discretion of a magazine editor, and owning the press. The way that we experience anything, whether it&#8217;s writing or art, is totally dependent on the context. Or is it?</p>

<p>If you saw the most beautiful piece of art you&#8217;d ever seen in a trash can, would it affect you the same way it would in a museum? How much value is intrinsic, how much is contextual? Why, and how often do we just submit to letting context inform value. Maybe because we need a filter or we&#8217;d go crazy. Curation is subjective, but we need it or we&#8217;d go crazy, like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p>The inclusion of something in an art museum makes it art. We approach art differently than we approach trash. This also applies to how we approach people. Hannah told me that people like her mom because she treats everyone the same exact way, never patronizing or idolizing. What would happen if we treated all our experiences the same way?</p>

<p>My thoughts are scattered, as usual, but this is essentially what I mean when I tell myself to experience everything through a certain lens. All we know for sure is what happens, but how we interpret our experiences is a matter of perception.</p>

<p>Approach with positivity. If we are too set in our ways, we won&#8217;t be able to appreciate.</p>

		<p>I posted this before, but I&#8217;m SO psyched that I got tickets to her talk at FIT on Tuesday. Paula Scher is one of my design idols!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a child of the sixties I was always rebellious. It came with the decade. I found that a form of rebelliousness is always present in my best work, and my work suffers when it is widely accepted and it becomes a part of the establishment. This talk will show how I have rebelled against Helvetica, expectations of others, and mostly rebelled against myself.</p>

Great Performers (from New York Magazine) by Paolo Pellegrin.

More behind-the-scenes photo fun, of performers out of the spotlight, but under the flash bulbs. Also see my earlier post of behind-the-scenes photos of Fashion Week.

		<p><blockquote>
  <p>Forget the other bills. The single won’t get you much more than a stiff nod and, these days, the fin is de rigueur. A tenner is a nice thought, but it’s also a message that you’re a Wal-Mart shopper, too cheap for the real deal. A twenty, placed in the right hand at the right moment, makes things happen. It gets you past the rope, beyond the door, into the secret files. The twenty hastens and chastens, beckons and tugs. The twenty, you see, is a verb. It’s all about action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&lt;</p>

<p>p&gt;And me, well, I’m all about action, too, because I am the original twenty-dollar millionaire. Give me a stack of twenties and I’ll pass them off as well as any mogul. Maybe better. My fortune rises and falls with the double sawbuck. And because of that, I’ve always wanted to test myself, to establish the weight and worth of a twenty in the world. So last month I took two grand in twenties, rolled them up, and left for New York. I was going to spend three days greasing palms from gate to gate and see what it got me.</p>

		<h3><p>&#8220;Stayed home from school because of a bad cold. Kerby went to Johnsons&#8217;. Norman shot a rabbit. He is 8 years old. First one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Late last year, my family found a line-a-day diary maintained by my great-aunt from 1937 to 1941. She was in her early teens, living on a small farm in rural Illinois with her two brothers, one of which was my grandfather.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating account of life in a bygone era, a time when my family&#8217;s only connections to the world were schoolhouse chatter and a neighbor&#8217;s radio.</p>

<p>Looking at the terse journal, my sister quipped, &#8220;This is the Twitter of the 1930s.&#8221; We glanced at each other and almost immediately began planning the Twitter account that would become <a href="http://twitter.com/Genny_Spencer" target="_blank"> Twitter.com/Genny_Spencer</a></p></h3>
