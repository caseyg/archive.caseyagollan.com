I built this Teepee with Oxbow visiting artists Deborah Butterfield and John Buck. It is made entirely out of salvaged materials. The structure is 3 bamboo poles I found behind a shed and the walls are made of tyvek and plastic bags zip-tied and stapled together. The walls acted like sails and caught enough wind to bring the teepee to the ground almost every night, but the resilient bamboo and plastic structure rarely needed mending. At the center of the structure hung a plum bob pendulum, but I planned to replace it with a chandelier. What was the coolest thing we did with the teepee? One night we projected a film about bees backwards onto a wall of the teepee and lay inside watching it. Looking back at it, it was a definitely precursor to my final project.<br />

My first sculpture assignment at Oxbow was to "create a sculpture that tells the story of the place that represents the interface between your internal and external landscapes." What a deliciously wordy first assignment. This was my first foray into conceptual art. I struggled with perfectionism, aesthetics, and conveying my message effectively. But what does it mean? I reasoned that my mind, my internal landscape, is small but infinite and the world, my external landscape, is large but finite. The space connecting these two places is a cone. I wasn't sure that I could understand the story of that place. I wanted to build a black cone to represent my idea. You see the cone, but when you try to look inside and find out the story, you start to question whether or not there even is a cone. This project was a major breakthrough for me in making honest, thoughtful art. This project helped me realize that if I don't know the answer to the big questions, it's okay to admit that, and it's much better than making something up.<br />

<b>Reciprocal</b><br />

For this assignment we were given a word, mine was reciprocal, and could do anything we wanted with that word. This project required little work on my part. I wanted to show that even though we rarely notice it, no matter where we go, we always leave our footprints. We gradually change our surroundings and in turn they affect us. These paper mats placed in front of active doorways turned form crisp white into a shade of murky brown where we had stepped. These four dirty sheets of paper were hung with the other art in the exhibit, but they had far more meaning than their surface value. Where did I go from here? This project got me really interested in how people move in set routes, for example, you could find your way around your house with your eyes closed. These mats show that people enter and exit the buildings at similar and consistent angles.<br />

This project was originally a painting project, but because of its installation and concept, I consider it a sculpture. This piece is much more personal than any of my other sculptures. Where the others express ideas, this expresses emotions and memories. It is much more representational. To convey the nature of repressed memories, I spray painted on shards of broken glass. The shards are painted on two sides, representing the tense versus the free memories. Though the entire piece is lit up in this photograph, to view the piece, which is covered during the day, the viewer must use a flashlight and can only see a small portion at a time. To see the other side, the viewer must walk around the bench, getting pricked by the thorns of a large rosebush.<br />
