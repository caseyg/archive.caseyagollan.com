		<description> &#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1619/o_bio.jpg" border="0" width="100" height="144" align="left"&#62;  I do, every day, something that makes me happy. What that happiness entails is constantly changing: one day I want to dance, the next I want to carve wood. I allow myself a little impulsiveness, and it keeps me on my toes. I used to think about what I wanted to do: sculpt, paint, draw, read, travel, learn, dance, stretch, sing, explore; I could go on forever. I want to do everything. But now when I want to dance, I dance. When I want to carve, I carve. I choose to live now, every day, and in the future.

		<description>As a curious person, I am constantly consuming. I try hard to be aware of myself and my surroundings, and take notes. I question everything. My art is a result of this questioning, as well as a form of experimentation. The process of creating art is valuable because I learn so much in the struggle to synthesize conflicting sources of knowledge and stimulation into something that is my own.

What’s more important to me than my artworks is the process by which they were created. For me, creating art is a learning process driven by my desire to understand, and art is the vehicle for my explorations.</description>

Text on page 2 reads:
ABOUT THIS NEW SKETCH BOOK

I don’t sketch all the time. So, as an artist, what do I do in my spare time?
	Think about things but let the thoughts pass rather than recording them,
	Get lost in concepts that I can’t make real,
	Voraciously consume books, magazines, and websites,
	Have conversations with people about art and life and whatever,
	Eat, sleep and or nap,
	Hug my dog, Miko,
	Design &#38; edit a newspaper and art/literary magazine,
	Sometimes write in a notebook,
	Sometimes play a computer game, 	Not sketch.

I have fumbled with numerous notebooks, sketchbooks, diaries, blogs, whatever.

I know that keeping a sketchbook helps me to collect my visual thoughts and trace their evolution, and I enjoy finding the roots of an idea. A good sketchbook can help me find out where an idea came from. A good sketchbook can show me how I develop. To show this, a good sketchbook needs to be consistent. 

I find it hard to be consistent without some kind of system. In seventeen years, I have almost never kept a good notebook/sketchbook. 

But that’s okay, because it takes alot of fumbling without a good system to figure out how a system should function.

I enjoy creating and collaborating with systems. This is a new system, I will fill the same sheet out every day. Sometimes, at the end of the day, I won’t have anything interesting to say. And on certain days I won’t want to do this at all.

But, I will do it every day, and worst case, if I forget or fall asleep or there is an earthquake, I will have to complete two sheets the next day.

And so the parameters are set, let the sketching begin. The next sheet is a blank example of the form which I am to fill out every day.

		<description>We’re all guilty of petty little crimes and it’s time we own up.


   

About this Project

It’s the little things we do that ruin it for the rest of us: clipping your nails in public, throwing your gum on the ground, or yelling at a waiter in a restaurant. By placing memorials to our mistakes in the places where we made them, we can publicly apologize for our actions and make sure that nobody repeats them. The note serves to publicly embarrass the person who committed the misdemeanor, and also redeem them by helping others to not make the same mistake in the same place.

Below: the Public Apology Form. Click here to download a pdf.

Original Call for Submissions (posted January 7th, 2009)

&#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1635/o_3181257840_a3d445f643_o.jpg" border="0" width="1024" height="768" align="left"&#62; 
Thank you Diana for the above example apology!

Background Info 
I’m applying to The Cooper Union and have an art project that would REALLY benefit from your help…it should take no more than 5 minutes.

My assignment is to:
design a platform, stage, or site for the redress of misdemeanors of public accountability (be specific-individual, corporate, state, media…)

What I need you to do

Read my response to that prompt:
We’re all guilty of petty little crimes and it’s time we own up. It’s the little things we do that ruin it for the rest of us: clipping your nails in public, throwing your gum on the ground, or yelling at a waiter in a restaurant. By placing memorials to our mistakes in the places where we made them, we can publicly apologize for our actions and make sure that nobody repeats them. The note serves to publicly embarrass the person who committed the misdemeanor, and also redeem them by helping others to not make the same mistake in the same place.


1. Print the public apology form.

2. Apologize! Each sheet has two forms, cut it down the middle, and then fill in both, or fill in one and give the other to a friend.

3. Post the completed form in the place where you made your mistake. Preferably somewhere public, where others will encounter it. Then take a photo! Your photo should show the place and the form, and if the form is not readable feel free to send a close up so that you can see the writing.

4. Email the image to me at caseygollan (at) gmail (dot) com.

5. Leave your apology up forever in the same place! The original concept was to use metal plaques almost like those ones “in memory of so and so” that are there long after the mistake has been made, to warn people to not make the same mistake in the same place.

That’s it! THANK YOU.


One Day Later

&#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1635/o_3180414981_199b0ed43f_b.jpg" border="0" width="1024" height="685" align="left"&#62; 
Yesterday at 4:04 pm, I posted an open call on facebook and this blog for anyone who wanted to participate, asking them to download the public apology form, fill it out, post it somewhere, and email me a photo. One of the best parts for me was seeing how some people who couldn’t print the form, or ran out of their copies reverted to post its cause they wanted to apologize anyway! One day later, I had 48 images in my inbox. To everyone that helped with this collaborative art project: THANK YOU!

Artist Statement
"As long as I love what I am doing and hate what I have done, I figure I am on the right track."  - David Barringer
Tasked with a month long exploration of an unanswerable question, I read a book, two plays, and scoured strange corners of the Internet. I immersed myself in the philosophies of Existentialism and Absurdism. I amassed pages of research and discovered that I love researching. Within hours, I rejected my initial ideas and exploded my thinking in every direction. This piece was almost blatant: existence, perception, choice, and intention. I kept worrying about having the time to make something imposing until, through conversations with others, I realized that I didn’t need impose. I could simply do something, such as hand over a signed affidavit for a conversation. This delighted me. I saw Lawrence Weiner’s text heavy retrospective at the Whitney in New York, and again, I was delighted by it. Thinking, writing, speaking, doing as art. Everything I create is a manifestation of what I have put into my mind. So, I let this piece come naturally to me. I imagined a place to think. It came to me in a day dream. Instead of reaching a false conclusion, I created a context for further discussion. The sculpture is just an object, the concept and the conversation, the intagingibles, are the art. It’s okay to not have, and not want, a concrete opinion. My beliefs are strong, yet constantly changing and I hope that that never stops. I don’t just want to talk about my piece, I want to talk inside it, or beside it, to you. I want to let it be a lens through which we can look at and talk about about existence, perception, choice, and intention.

About This Project
I made this outdoor installation sculpture for my final project assignment at the Oxbow School in December 2007. The sculpture hangs from a tree and descends to the ground, creating a space large enough that about 5 -10 participants may enter and see the world around them diffused through the material. It creates an intimate environment for discussion that responds to every breath of the wind. The space is truly ethereal. Dimensions of the uninstalled sheet of plastic are roughly 25 x 40 ft. The material is one large sheet of plastic constructed by overlapping layers of industrial stretch wrap. For the most part, the stretch wrap clings to itself, but small portions and the seam of the walls were fixed with spray adhesive.

		<description>Transforming the context of a beach.

Garbage: a pile of bricks on the side of the road. Art: a pile of bricks on a pedestal in the Museum of Modern Art. This is the power of context, something I struggle with in not only creating, but viewing art.

“What is art?” this is an interminable debate that I don’t wish to go into here, but we know that at least one “condition” that makes art art is context.

One aspect of context is place: Earth, My Home, A Rainforest, The MoMA. These places help define the objects inside them: How do we approach them? What do they mean? But they also help define how we behave in relation to the space: Can I touch that painting? Can I take off my shoes?

What I am most interested in, however, is the power of an object to change the context of its own surroundings.

At the end of the summer, I spent a few days on the beach stacking rocks. Stacking rocks is a meditative process, and some would say an art unto itself. In a few days, my little sister, a friend, and I had created about twenty stacked rock towers in a small area of the beach.

When I returned to the beach a few days later some stacks were knocked over and some stacks were still standing, but I also found something unexpected—new stacks. An upside down beer bottle, pushed into the sand, was the base. On top of that was placed a vertical rock supported by sticks. I kept returning to the spot every few days to find something new. One day, I returned to find every single stack knocked down and combined into a giant rock pile. I couldn’t help but think, “what a beautiful new piece!” After the stacks were gone, nobody knew what to do with the space and my sculpture park slowly faded away. I couldn’t help but feel good because I hadn’t expected anyone else to run with my idea, and to respond to the small change in context that I had made.

I had transformed a beach scattered with stones into a man-made sculpture park. What I didn’t intend was for the sculptures to transform the beach into a public art studio, and for the experience of stacking rocks to transform my thinking as an artist.

		<description>Four installations created in fall of 2007 at the Oxbow School in Napa, California.

Teepee
Previous&#38;nbsp;/&#38;nbsp;Next image&#38;nbsp;(1 of 2)&#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1517/o_01.jpg" border="0" width="700" height="466" align="left"&#62;&#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1517/o_02.jpg" border="0" width="700" height="466" align="left"&#62;&#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1517/o_03.jpg" border="0" width="700" height="466" align="left"&#62;
I built this Teepee with Oxbow visiting artists Deborah Butterfield and John Buck. It is made entirely out of salvaged materials. The structure is 3 bamboo poles I found behind a shed and the walls are made of tyvek and plastic bags zip-tied and stapled together. The walls acted like sails and caught enough wind to bring the teepee to the ground almost every night, but the resilient bamboo and plastic structure rarely needed mending. At the center of the structure hung a plum bob pendulum, but I planned to replace it with a chandelier. What was the coolest thing we did with the teepee? One night we projected a film about bees backwards onto a wall of the teepee and lay inside watching it. Looking back at it, it was a definitely precursor to my final project.


Cones

My first sculpture assignment at Oxbow was to "create a sculpture that tells the story of the place that represents the interface between your internal and external landscapes." What a deliciously wordy first assignment. This was my first foray into conceptual art. I struggled with perfectionism, aesthetics, and conveying my message effectively. But what does it mean? I reasoned that my mind, my internal landscape, is small but infinite and the world, my external landscape, is large but finite. The space connecting these two places is a cone. I wasn't sure that I could understand the story of that place. I wanted to build a black cone to represent my idea. You see the cone, but when you try to look inside and find out the story, you start to question whether or not there even is a cone. This project was a major breakthrough for me in making honest, thoughtful art. This project helped me realize that if I don't know the answer to the big questions, it's okay to admit that, and it's much better than making something up.


Reciprocal

For this assignment we were given a word, mine was reciprocal, and could do anything we wanted with that word. This project required little work on my part. I wanted to show that even though we rarely notice it, no matter where we go, we always leave our footprints. We gradually change our surroundings and in turn they affect us. These paper mats placed in front of active doorways turned form crisp white into a shade of murky brown where we had stepped. These four dirty sheets of paper were hung with the other art in the exhibit, but they had far more meaning than their surface value. Where did I go from here? This project got me really interested in how people move in set routes, for example, you could find your way around your house with your eyes closed. These mats show that people enter and exit the buildings at similar and consistent angles.


Memories
Previous&#38;nbsp;/&#38;nbsp;Next image&#38;nbsp;(1 of 2)&#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1517/o_07.jpg" border="0" width="700" height="466" align="left"&#62; &#60;img src="http://portfolio.caseyagollan.com/media/1517/o_08.jpg" border="0" width="700" height="466" align="left"&#62; 
This project was originally a painting project, but because of its installation and concept, I consider it a sculpture. This piece is much more personal than any of my other sculptures. Where the others express ideas, this expresses emotions and memories. It is much more representational. To convey the nature of repressed memories, I spray painted on shards of broken glass. The shards are painted on two sides, representing the tense versus the free memories. Though the entire piece is lit up in this photograph, to view the piece, which is covered during the day, the viewer must use a flashlight and can only see a small portion at a time. To see the other side, the viewer must walk around the bench, getting pricked by the thorns of a large rosebush.
