<p>There are some valid arguments for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorphism">skeuomorphic design</a>, for example mimicking the turning of real-life pages in a virtual book on the iPad, besides &#8220;wow, that looks cool!&#8221; One good one is that <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/441478284/how-real">we&#8217;re in a transitional period</a> where mimicry is being used to help people learn how to interact with these new touch devices, and that skeuomorphism will be replaced by less decorative interfaces in due time. There are also the criticisms: some <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/31/torn_paper_derangement_syndrome_tpds_">vehemently oppose</a> any computer interface with a torn paper edge and others are trying to invent <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2011/04/idea_a_new_save_icon.html">less dated replacements for the &#8220;save&#8221; icon</a> (which is still commonly represented by a floppy disk). <a href="http://calvetica.com/">Calvetica</a>, a minimalist calendar replacement for iPhone, is an interesting example of an app which eschews fussy realistic design, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily implement <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view">crazy new functionalities</a>—it&#8217;s just a good, clean, basic calendar.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkldwruNun1qzrmn8.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Style issues aside, the most important argument <em>against</em> skeuomorphism is that imitating the physical world on screen stops applications from taking advantage of new kinds of interactions which can only exist in a world unburdened by ordinary physics or materiality. Ted Nelson, who coined the term &#8220;hypertext&#8221; in 1963, has this vision of <a href="http://transliterature.org/">where digital literature is headed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A document is not necessarily a simulation of paper.  In the most general sense, a document is a package of ideas created by human minds and addressed to human minds, intended for the furtherance of those ideas and those minds.  Human ideas manifest as text, connections, diagrams and more: thus how to store them and present them is a crucial issue for civilization.</p>
  
  <p>The furtherance of the ideas, and the furtherance of the minds that present them and take them in, are the real objectives.  And so what is important in documents is the expression, reception and re-use of ideas.  Connections, annotations, and most especially re-use&#8212; the traceable flow of content among documents and their versions&#8212; must be our central objectives, not the simulation of paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nelson also made this illustration of what documents might look like in his world:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklg5bM7dV1qzrmn8.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Documents wrap around each other like donuts and pick-up sticks, float through space, and link bi-directionally. Nelson&#8217;s ideas are interesting, but <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html">have some fundamental flaws</a> and therefore have failed to catch on. Still, I can&#8217;t help looking at his Transliterature spec and thinking that he may have been on to new functionalities which transcend skeuomorphism.</p>

<p>I was reminded of all this today because for the first time in recent memory I came across an interface that wasn&#8217;t necessarily skeuomorphic or hyper. <a href="http://planetary.bloom.io/">Planetary</a> is a free iPad app that allows you to navigate your music library as if it were a solar system.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklf4z5RrY1qzrmn8.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The demo video below gives a sense of how it works: you select a letter to narrow down artists, then tap through a &#8220;galaxy&#8221; a few times towards an individual song. After poking around for a few minutes I realized that Planetary is essentially the same hierarchical <code>artist &gt; album &gt; song</code> navigation in use on every iPod, but dressed up as a spinning 3D galaxy. Planetary isn&#8217;t skeuomorphic because it isn&#8217;t referencing the conventions of any existing physical or virtual organization <em>for music</em> and it isn&#8217;t hyper because it proposes no new functionality. Rather, Planetary represents a kind of mixing of metaphors—an orbital solar system and a hierarchical music library—to create what I think of as a fantasy interface.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there are tons more that I can&#8217;t remember, but the other fantasy interface that comes to mind is <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/3990446010/speeder-reader-an-experiment-in-the-future-of">Speeder Reader</a>, an experimental book-as-arcade-game that poses the question: &#8220;what is it like to drive through a book?&#8221; In the photograph below, a woman uses Speeder Reader to drive through the science fiction story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podkayne_of_Mars"><em>Podkayne of Mars</em></a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklg1s3NQZ1qzrmn8.png" alt=""/></p>

<p><a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/a_place_to_talk/">Mandy Brown</a> recently posted about <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>, an app which makes a &#8220;magazine&#8221; out of your social media streams, as a far more subtle but equally interesting example of an interface which mixes metaphors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flipboard aggregates content from your social graph in really lovely ways, but the juxtaposition of oral culture in an essentially literate design doesn’t always make sense. It’s quite odd to see your friend’s tweet about their breakfast burrito elevated to a strikingly designed pull quote. The pull quote is a design pattern that emerged from a culture of publishing—from a process by which an editor would carefully select a bit of text that, when extracted and enlarged, would resonate with the greater work. But here, there is no greater work, and no editor: only the blind act of an algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike Nelson, who over-ambitiously sought to reinvent the way we use and create information, the creators of Planetary describe their work as creating, &#8220;pop-cultural instruments for data expression and exploration.&#8221; In the realm of cool stuff, Planetary is delightful to tap around in and may in fact encourage a different kind of exploration of music libraries (which in their current incarnation resemble spreadsheets). However, the logic—or lack thereof—behind these <em>beautiful!</em> and <em>fun!</em> mixed metaphor interfaces is something that I&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on.</p>
