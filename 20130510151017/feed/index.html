            <p>Hi again, friends and friends-of-friends—</p>

<p>What needs doing? I'm available to take on new work, now that two of my jobs are finished, two are being polished off, and two have turned into ongoing commitments that are small and sporadic.</p>

<p>I like weird jobs and good people. I'm down with remote work. Nothing is too small to propose. Some things I <a href="/for-hire">can do</a> are: write and edit; organize, administrate, and strategize; design and build websites; make videos and photographs; and move your boxes.</p>

<p>If you think I could help you OR you know somebody that I should talk to OR you just want to say hi:</p>

<p><center>👉&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;<a class="rainbow" href="mailto:hello@caseyagollan.com?subject=____%20Needs%20Doing">hello@caseyagollan.com</a>&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;👻&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;<a class="rainbow" href="http://twitter.com/caseyg">@CaseyG</a>&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;👈</center></p>

<p>I also wrote a little bit below about the kinds of work I've been doing in the past nine months.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and please feel free to pass this along.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nine months ago I wrote <a href="/for-hire">an open cover letter</a> asking the internet for work.</p>

<p>After putting out the letter I received 14 leads. Four-teen!</p>

<p>Six of these never went beyond an initial email or three. Or we planned to get coffee or something and never did.</p>

<p>Nine went on to real life interviews or proposals. I talked to: an artist, the producers of a social media awards ceremony, a hedge fund startup, a poet, two schools, an editor, a gallerist, and a web design shop.</p>

<p>I ended up taking on six projects:</p>

<ol>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//zach.jpg"><span>Doing research with <a href="http://twitter.com/zachlieberman">Zach Lieberman</a> for <a href="http://vimeo.com/69437363">his talk at Eyeo</a> on education, and organizing some materials for a workshop he did in Japan</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//bhqfu.jpg"><span>A four-month fellowship at <a href="http://bhqfu.org">BHQFU</a>, where I was <a href="https://education.hackpad.com/">teaching</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/freecooperunion">organizing</a> around free education with <a href="http://twitter.com/victoriasobel">Victoria</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pleasedontfront">Joe</a>.

<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//source.png"><span>Copy-editing articles on journalism and code over at <a href="http://source.opennews.org">Source</a>, mostly with <a href="http://twitter.com/kissane">Erin</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kiostark">Kio</a>, but also <a href="http://twitter.com/erika_owens">Erika</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dansinker">Dan</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanpitts">Ryan</a>.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>I tracked 366.05 work hours (though I underreported since I was mostly tracking hours to help myself understand my work patterns), and netted $19,541.66. That <em>seems</em> to me like a lot of money to have made from scuttling around doing things that I like, but I'm still broke because&#38;hellip;New York.</p>

<p>There were also lots of non-work-related things that happened in the past nine months:</p>

<ul>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//collonade.JPG"><span>Had my senior show at Cooper Union. Mostly a big diff, analyzing how the Board's governance has changed since 1859. (Going to get that documentation online…someday.)</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//empty.jpg"><span>Didn't graduate. Not on purpose but not by accident. Ask me about my degree only if you want to get sucked into an hour-long rant on the changing nature of credentials and higher education.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//dna.png"><span>Put <a href="http://github.com/caseyg/dna">my genome on Github</a>. Fork me!</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//occupation.jpg"><span>Occupied the President's Office at Cooper for 65 days.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//stigmergy.jpg"><span>Spent two weeks in the woods with the Finnish side of my family. There is an hour of my life that I will never forget where I stared at an ant hill and thought about stigmergy.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//nspc.jpg"><span>Spent a few days at the <a href="http://studentpower2013.org">National Student Power Convergence</a> in Wisconsin learning and meeting student organizers.</span></li>
<li data-okimage="../content/235.what-needs-doing//politicsofdestruction.jpg"><span>Set off the smoke alarm at e-flux during <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/96010/the-politics-of-parody-free-cooper-union-at-e-flux/">a dramatic reading</a> of a leaked Cooper Board meeting.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I attempted to write about this ALL before realizing that I could spend more time writing about the past months than it took to live them. Aren't you glad this wasn't 15,000 words? Instead, let's get together and talk!</p>

<p>Hope to work together,</p>

<p>Casey</p>

   <title>Meditation on Mediation</title>

            <p>Students for a Free Cooper Union just officially declined mediation, as proposed by the college's administration. The <a href="http://cusos.org/post/53843538845/occupying-students-decline-mediation-as-proposed-by">official statement is here</a>, my own thoughts follow:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/5bb6467b9544e2399c6a57115dfebed0/tumblr_inline_moajwsHBmC1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Students attend a public presentation by mediators Bathabile Mthombeni and Carol Liebman.</em></p>

<p>How do you sit at a table with someone whose authority you do not recognize? This question remained unanswered by the end of a nearly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxzq8GPKYLk">three-hour long presentation on mediation</a> at the <a href="http://cusos.org/the-free-cooper-union-salon-step-down/">Free Cooper Union Salon</a>. The authority in question is Cooper Union’s administration and Board of Trustees. Those invited — daresay coaxed — to the table (this time a literal, not <a href="http://cooperunion.info/posters/the-table-is-on-the-table.jpg">proverbial</a>, conference room table) are the Students for a Free Cooper Union. In response to our indefatigable occupation of the college president’s office, begun over a month ago on May 8th, the college’s president, vice presidents, and deans solicited the services of professional mediators. At a rate of $225 an hour, to be paid by the administration, this team was charged with bringing clarity to the protest and perhaps uncovering shared interests between the parties.</p>

<p>Yet the proposed mediation was fraught from the very start with problems:</p>

<p><strong>Asymmetry</strong></p>

<p>According to the mediators, the administration initiated this proposed mediation by shopping around within the mediation community for somebody to work with us. The administration chose two mediators and met with them at least twice before anybody involved consulted the students. This goes against the mediators’ own principle of keeping their communications with both parties symmetrical, e.g. after speaking with one party always speak with the other. As the administration has agreed to foot the bill for the proceedings, the administration would also effectively be hiring the mediators. With no insult intended to the mediators’ professionalism, these factors call into question claims of “impartiality”.</p>

<p><strong>Expense</strong></p>

<p>The Cooper community wants to be the administration, not interface with it. Why should it cost $225 for students to speak with already overcompensated administrators? The need for a high-priced translator between “dissidents” and “bureaucrats” supports the students’ own argument that the administration’s idea of how to communicate with the community is dysfunctional. Hiring mediators follows the eerie pattern of administrators attempting to solve problems by throwing money at them.</p>

<p><strong>Vacuum</strong></p>

<p>In response to a question about student representation on the Board, Chairman Mark Epstein once told a student they’d, “have to learn to accept a no”. Now suddenly, during the occupation, this same administration wants to talk? The appointed delegates — Trustee Richard Lincer, Board Secretary Lawrence Cacciatore, and Architecture Dean Elizabeth O’Donnell — represent a small grouping of individuals who lack the power to effect real change. Even more troublesome than the lack of agency of these individuals is that there would never have been a real discussion, let alone a proposal for mediation, had students not occupied the president’s office. To pretend, in initiating mediation, that we are suddenly at a point where we can sit across a table and work things out is to ignore the chasm between administrators and community members which grows with every day that the administration chooses to respond to the community in silence. Students are well aware of the fact that if we let up now without securing real seats on the Board for students, faculty, and staff — or changing the structure of Cooper’s governance completely — the community will not continue to have a say outside of spaces opened as a result of our direct-action tactics for a short period of time. The changes we ultimately seek are structural.</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong></p>

<p>Despite the appointed mediators’ insistence that a good mediation is driven by both parties in mutual agreement to mediate, we have been given a “hard sell” on multiple occasions and pressed to act fast by Dean O’Donnell and the mediators themselves. Yet the mediators don’t actually seem to have the time to devote to our mediation. One of the two proposed mediators would have to drop out after a week, leaving one mediator to contend with our case herself. Further, the remaining mediator told us that her schedule would start to get difficult if we could not agree to start in the several days after we met her. Students too are busy doing everything it takes to maintain the occupation and push forward projects designed to go over the heads of Cooper’s current administration, making the time commitment unrealistic for us.</p>

<p><strong>Representation</strong></p>

<p>Students for a Free Cooper Union is a fluid, horizontally-organized group. We’re attempting to preach alternative forms of governance by practicing them ourselves. To elect a small number of students to “represent” our group at a table with the administration’s delegates potentially undermines this intentional paradigm shift. The mediators admitted that engaging in their process without a small, fixed group of representatives would be difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Intent</strong></p>

<p>In a mass-email sent to all students, alumni, faculty, and even parents several weeks ago, the administration called the occupation “poisonous and dangerous” and attempted to state incorrectly that students had declined mediation which had not yet been proposed. So why circle back for mediation now? And why mediate specifically between the occupying students and three administrators? If a mediation is needed, it is not between the administration and the occupation, but between the administration and the community at large — students, faculty, staff, alumni, neighbors, and friends — whom they continue to ostracize. The parties proposed to sit at this table imply that this discussion is about the occupation. The occupation should be a catalyst for a larger conversation, not the subject of conversation itself. The conversation that truly needs to happen is one amongst our community about issues larger than this protest, and larger even than Cooper Union, about the crisis of higher education and student debt.</p>

<p>Finally, we’re hard pressed to believe that this mediation could bring any more clarity to our demands, which have been republished and restated countless times since December of last year.</p>

<p>1) <strong>President Bharucha steps down.</strong></p>

<p>2) <strong>The Board of Trustees must immediately implement structural changes with the goal of creating open flows of information and democratic decision-making structures.</strong> The administration’s gross mismanagement of the school cannot be reversed within the same systems which allowed the crisis to occur. To this end, we have outlined actions that the board must take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record board meetings and make minutes publicly available.</li>
<li>Appoint a student and faculty member from each school as voting members of the board.</li>
<li>Implement a process by which board members may be removed through a vote from the Cooper Union community, comprised of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators.</li>
</ul>

<p>3) <strong>The administration must publicly affirm the college’s commitment to free education.</strong> They will stop pursuing new tuition-based educational programs and eliminate other ways in which students are charged for education.</p>

<p>Clarity is not the question.</p>

<p>What is questionable, however, is Bharucha’s silence throughout the past two years and recent events including: a community revolt against his leadership, safety violations endangering students such as blocked fire stairs and armed security on campus, the leak of an indefensible closed-door meeting transcript, and the ongoing occupation. This mediation reads as more silence from Bharucha.</p>

<p><em><strong>Silence is golden.</strong> In a transcript of a September 2012 board meeting leaked by the Village Voice, former trustee Vikas Kapoor advocates “not saying anything” as a board policy.</em></p>

<p>For the Board, talking their way out of tricky situations has proven to be a successful strategy in the past, such as in September 2012 when students blocking a hallway to the boardroom were invited in to speak with trustees following a closed-door meeting. The conversation proved fruitless for the students but successful for the trustees, who de-escalated a tricky exit.</p>

<p><em><strong>Diffusion by discussion.</strong> Jamshed Bharucha speaks to students, one of whom is lying on the ground wearing a shirt which reads “TUITION AT COOPER — OVER MY DEAD BODY”, outside of a closed-door board meeting in September 2012.</em></p>

<p>Unable to remove the protesters this time around without decimating their reputation, the administration has proposed a flawed, irrelevant mediation process as a misguided next move. If the administration cannot start talking openly to the entire the community, nor address our demands, what are they still doing here?</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/085dc5cdaa8807ab89383b94c6bb04d4/tumblr_inline_moajt3R8121qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><strong>Shared interests?</strong> In a transcript of a September 2012 board meeting leaked by the Village Voice, trustee Tom Driscoll discusses how the Board plans to deflect questions in a meeting scheduled with Friends of Cooper Union.</em></p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Board met at an undisclosed location (for the second consecutive time) to have yet-another closed-door meeting. Meanwhile in the Occupied Office of the Presidents an alumnus led a session not on mediation but on meditation. The students were joined by alumni and friends from New Jersey to California to Mexico in a simultaneous “channeling of elevated thoughts towards the board,” reconceptualizing the trustees in our mind’s eyes’ as, “a group of small children who need to be reminded sternly yet lovingly that they need to clean up their mess, pack up their toys and share with others.”</p>

<p>Today, the students, faculty, alumni, and friends will congregate for a 24 hour straight <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11hLE5zEBNMqqO-Fyym9lxApVL96hTSMWzIHhiBcbss0/pub">marathon of researching</a>, writing, dreaming, doodling, and synthesizing ideas about what an administration that is more functional than the one we’re dealing with right now might look like. How might we run the school?, as some say we have been doing since December’s lock-in which reclaimed the media narrative and caused the entire PR department to jump ship.</p>

<p>“This occupation,” remarked one alumnus who recently visited us, “is a tuning fork for the Cooper community.” In declining the administration’s request to engage in a formal mediation process between themselves and the occupying students, we hope to sound a tone that is meditative, agitating, and most importantly unrelenting.</p>

<p><em><strong>In power, but not popular.</strong> An online petition created by Cooper’s administration demanding that the “students engaged in [the] sit-in...vacate the office immediately” failed to break 600 signatures, while a similar online petition launched by community group Friends of Cooper Union supporting a statement of “No confidence in President Bharucha and Chairman Epstein” has garnered nearly 2,400 signatures.</em></p>

            <p>‎(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</p>

<p>A lot of people have approached me up in arms about shutting up unless I've got a financial solution. I'm of the opinion that financial solutions with any integrity at all will only happen in conjunction with other types of more important changes: systemic, rhetorical, technical.</p>

<p>So here is something nerdy:</p>

<p>This repository contains an archive of <a href="http://cooper.edu">Cooper Union</a>'s Bylaws from 1996 - 2012. Having done nothing more than pull these documents together into a folder, they already highlight the sloppy and outmoded manner in which Cooper's administrators create, distribute, and archive information.</p>

<p>Going forward I hope to use these documents as raw-material for experiments outlining best practices for living documents and content management systems that are transparent and accountable.</p>

<p>If this collection doesn't look particularly interesting that's because it actually isn't! But getting access to this ostensibly public document's history has been an arduous, bottlenecked procedure (it shouldn't have to be)...and the collection isn't even complete. Where, for example, are the original 1972 Bylaws which all these revisions amend? Where is the history of every document? If we weren't keeping it already why aren't we starting this second?</p>

<p>After a month of heckling the Secretary to the Board of Trustees, a mixed-bag of documents was passed to the college's Library, whose staff quickly posted them online. The files varied substantially in formatting and accessibility and were therefore hard to compare. I set about standardizing the documents as much as possible so the ways that this governing text has changed over time can begin to surface.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/caseyg/bylaws/master/img/before-after.png" alt="Before and After" /></p>

<p>The first step of this is that most of the PDFs have been converted by hand into <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, a plain-text writing format that provides for a little bit of structure. If you're adventurous, you can already download the files in the <a href="https://github.com/caseyg/bylaws/tree/master/markdown">/markdown</a> directory and plug them into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff tool</a> like <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com">Kaleidoscope</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/caseyg/bylaws/master/img/kaleidoscope-screenshot.png" alt="Kaleidoscope Screenshot" /></p>

<p>In my dream-world I use this space to build tools that shoehorn these principles directly into the administrative workflows responsible for creating and distributing this mess, so that ridiculous retroactive unpacking efforts such as this are not necessary.</p>

<p>But this is a start.</p>

<p>The original documents were accessed from <a href="http://library.cooper.edu/archive/bylaws/cu_archives_docs_bylaws.html">the library website</a> on January 23rd, 2013. The six PDF files available on via the library are archived in the <a href="https://github.com/caseyg/bylaws/tree/master/pdf">/pdf</a> directory of this repository. One version of the bylaws, made available by the library in HTML, is not yet archived here.</p>

            <p>Hello friends and friends of friends,</p>

<p>This May I'm graduating from Cooper Union and entering the <del>void</del> world...which means I'm looking for work as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I have a weird hunch (or maybe just a <em>hope</em>) that — because the internet is a weird place — my next move <em>could</em> be getting paid to do something with somebody who I <a href="http://twitter.com/caseyg/following"><strong>already</strong> know</a> and admire.</p>

<p>If you're reading this, maybe that's you?</p>

<p>You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:hello@caseyagollan.com">hello@caseyagollan.com</a> or by phone at 914.471.0959.</p>

<p><em>Or</em> keep scrolling for a little bit more about things I can do (making websites, writing and editing, social media, video and photography, organizing and strategizing, and moving your boxes), things I want to learn, and how much money I need to make to keep living in New York.</p>

<p style="text-align:right">—Casey</p>

<h2>Making websites</h2>

<p><img src="http://caseyagollan.com/content/140.girl-walk-all-day-website/girlwalk-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3><a href="http://girlwalkallday.com">Girl Walk // All Day</a></h3>

<p>When my friends <a href="http://wildcombination.com">Jacob and Youngna</a> blew through the funding target for their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/720656387/girl-walk-all-day">Kickstarter-funded</a>-music-video-epic <em>Girl Walk // All Day</em> they decided to take their movie on a worldwide tour. Working off of the graphic design stylings of <a href="http://kellianderson.com">Kelli Anderson</a>, and with the back end programming help of <a href="http://tangentialism.com">David Yee</a>, we launched a fairly complex website in a matter of weeks. Youngna wrote about some of her favorite parts of the site <a href="http://blog.youngnapark.com/2011/10/girl-walk-all-day-redesign-trailer.html">on her blog</a>. Because the movie is all about dancing across New York City <em>and</em> was slated to premiere at <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/">Brooklyn Beta</a>, I pushed for making the site completely responsive. I was happy to see that the <a href="https://twitter.com/RWD/status/125587985449234433">audience approved</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://cooperunion.biz">CooperUnion.biz</a></h3>

<p>One December evening my roommates <a href="http://aaron-graham.com">Aaron</a>, <a href="http://g-i-b-s-o-n.com">Alex</a>, and I threw together this parody site skewering the corporatization of our alma-mater. (Part of ongoing work about <a href="http://facebook.com/FreeCooperUnion">Free-ing Cooper Union</a>.) It has since been shared by the likes of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10151421401446616&#38;amp;id=96761506615">The Yes Men</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HuffPostArts/status/334376608188203008">Huffington Post</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AiANews/status/334415141179363329">Art in America</a>; written up on <a href="http://fastcoexist.com/1682073/tricky-activists-protest-the-corporatization-of-education-with-a-brilliant-fake-site">Fast Company's Co.Exist blog</a>; and made the rounds in classrooms at NYU and the New School. I like doing things like this: funny, fast, effective.</p>

<h3>20x200</h3>

<p>I started interning for <a href="http://twitter.com/jenbee">Jen Bekman</a> right out of high school, and within a couple of months was hired (to my disbelief) as a half-time in-house designer. I worked there for two years, designing and shipping production quality HTML/CSS for large portions of the site, as well as making countless experiments and prototypes. I learned about the ins-and-outs of startup e-commerce like test-driven design, iterative development, and collecting a ton of metrics to optimize everything. The dream team that Jen put together, many of whom I consider to be mentors, have gone on to create things like Girl Walk, <a href="http://editorially.com">Editorially</a>, and <a href="http://tinybop.com">Tinybop</a>.</p>

<h2>Writing and editing</h2>

<p><img src="http://caseyagollan.com/content/155.book-review-programmed-visions/book-review-programmed-visions.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3>Book review</h3>

<p><a href="http://joannemcneil.com">Joanne McNeil</a>, former editor of <a href="http://rhizome.org"><em>Rhizome</em></a> (and one of my all-time <a href="http://internet-of-dreams.com">favorite bloggers</a>), handed me a copy of Wendy Hui Kyong Chun's <a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jan/23/book-review-programmed-visions-software-and-memory"><em>Programmed Visions</em></a> which I reviewed for the site.</p>

<h3>Essay</h3>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://pooool.info/user-generated-content">User-Generated Content</a>, a lengthy musing on artists, social networks, interface design, and institutional critique, for <a href="http://pooool.info"><em>Pool</em></a> (which editor <a href="http://louisdoulas.info">Louis Doulas</a> later approached me to <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/pool/">redesign</a>).</p>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>When I worked at Jen Bekman I wrote over <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/966905918/writing-on-hey-hot-shot">250 blog posts</a> on the artists we worked with.</p>

<h2>Social media</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Student activists take note. @<a href="https://twitter.com/freecooperunion">freecooperunion</a> is giving a master class in how to use Twitter as an activist tool.</p>&#38;mdash; Angus Johnston (@studentactivism) <a href="https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/326789400849707008">April 23, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>There's a lot of crazytalk out there about juicing up one's social media presence for profit and fame, but I personally subscribe to the idea that if you just <em>be human</em> good things will follow. While I was responsible for social media at Jen Bekman our little community was generally happy and thriving. I was the human behind our Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr accounts, and I launched our Tumblr. I drafted a several page internal guide including a rundown of my workflows and tools-of-the-trade as well as best practices regarding pacing, replies, and tone. This is the kind of thing that's just second-nature for me, maybe because I grew up on computers and can never stop looking at my phone.</p>

<p>Now, alongside <a href="http://pleasedontfront.tumblr.com">Joe</a>, I'm at the helm of Free Cooper Union on <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Angus Johnston, a <a href="http://studentactivism.net">historian of student activism</a> at CUNY, recently <a href="https://twitter.com/studentactivism/status/326789400849707008">called us</a> a "master class in how to use Twitter as an activist tool." Only, soon we might not be the underdog anymore, seeing as how we've <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=469887223092101&#38;amp;set=a.392421814171976.58168719.391957684218389&#38;amp;type=1">surpassed the official Cooper Union page</a> in popularity. Oops.</p>

<h2>Making videos and photographing</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qhowml0sBBI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is a little embarrassing <em>but</em> I wrote, recorded, shot, starred in, and edited this music video intending to seduce financial transparency out of Cooper Union's administrators. A kind of oblique open government initiative. The <em>New York Times</em>, covering student protests, acknowledged me as a "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/nyregion/cooper-unions-tradition-of-free-tuition-may-be-near-end.html?pagewanted=all#p[DltAwt]">terrible but amusing rapper</a>."</p>

<p>But that's besides the point, which is that I can help <em>you</em> make videos.</p>

<h2>Organizing and Strategizing</h2>

<p><img src="http://caseyagollan.com/content/160.systems/systems-01.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last March I published a kind of <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/systems/read">screed on <em>systems</em></a>. I'm hungry to do more systems thinking along the lines of Donella Meadows' <a href="http://www.sustainer.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf"><em>Leverage Points</em></a>, John Gall's <a href="http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~fasiha/systemantics/"><em>Systemantics</em></a>, James C. Scott's <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300078152"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, and O'Reilly's <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/open_government"><em>Open Government</em></a> anthology — though I'm not sure how I could do this as a form of employment (beyond <em>consulting</em> which I lament in the systems essay linked above).</p>

<p>Similarly, my favorite part of the design work I've done has always been the more abstract organizational side rather than the "graphics".</p>

<h2>Moving your boxes or whatever</h2>

<p>Liz Danzico's tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/bobulate/status/1280455190">mentornship</a> from so long ago has really stuck with me. An irrational fear I have is getting too deep into work that pretends to be meaningful but is actually just stealing three-quarters of my brainspace while ultimately being about serving a revenue target. A lot of startup culture seems this way to me, and it's the kind of thing that makes me want to go off the grid and never use a computer again. That's why, rather than having some comfortable bourgeois job, I'd be happy handling some brilliant person's bullshit if it means getting to learn from and with them.</p>

<h2>What I want to get better at</h2>

<p>I want to get better at all the things listed above and I hope that I can do so by working. I'm far from great at any of these things, but competent enough at this point to bounce across disciplines and job titles to get shit done.</p>

<p>Also, I'd really like to get fluent enough at back end coding so that I can whip up a web app every time an idea pops into my head instead of mucking around until I go crazy. If working with you could mean you teaching me more about that, I'm so down.</p>

<h2>Cost of living</h2>

<p>I've lived in New York City since coming to school here in 2009, supported generously by a full-scholarship from The Cooper Union, rent money from my parents, and pocket change from various employers and freelance clients.</p>

<p>The table below shows every dollar to pass out of my bank account over three full years in the city, including rent, utilities, and food.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>Spending</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2010</td>
        <td>$21,010.04</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2011</td>
        <td>$27,057.20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2012</td>
        <td>$24,516.54</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>For the immediate future, I'd like to continue living in the same shitty Brooklyn apartment that I've shared with my beloved roommates for the past three years. As you can see — in the interest of transparency — the numbers above (after taxes) are the absolute floor of what I'll need to cobble together to live without putting anything away in savings. I have little desire to exceed these amounts if the work is awesome. Really.</p>

<h2>Thanks, and contact info again</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading, and please feel free to pass this open cover letter on to anyone you think sounds like a good fit.</p>

<p>I hope we can work together!</p>

<p>You can reach me by email at <a href="mailto:hello@caseyagollan.com">hello@caseyagollan.com</a> or phone at 914.471.0959.</p>

            <p>I would never have thought of putting BOOK SUMMARIES on this crappy little screen. It isn't a comfortable reading experience. But I am doomed to work my way through three book summaries before getting bored and realizing that the “home” button on the business book summary page is not actually a button. Like whoever put together the fucking hypercard forgot to actually hook it up. It looks like a button. All the other buttons reluctantly bring me places. This one does not. I am unsurprised that nobody caught the error because I am surprised that this screen of business book summaries even exists on my rectangle.</p>

<h2>Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy</h2>

<p>Shuffling back from Lavatory through military graveyard of screens. One big screen? I can't discern differences between programs. Only "adult programs" and "cartoons." I don't notice anyone on the STUDYplay section. STUDYplay fills my rectangle with small, dense text, two big arrows, and a windows scrollbar. Mom looks over and is like…what is that? And I am like, um, it’s a five page summary of a book on the history of corporate espionage. And she is like Huh and falls back asleep.</p>

<p>This book summary is LIFE CHANGING. Everything finally makes sense. DO YOU HEAR ME LUFTHANSA? I decided on YOUR plane that if I am going to give up on living the dream it will be in the most fucked up way possible. If I can't marry rich by the time I graduate from college I will seek a career in "the secret world of corporate espionage" to support my research on "time set aside for leisure."</p>

<h2>The 2020 Workplace</h2>

<p>Business books! With their irreducible logic. Randomly generated endlessly recombined ceaseless: To Making You Think You Are Learning And. About Your “Reputation Capital” And The “Acute Global Talent Shortage” And The “2020 Mindset” And Why “Crowdsourcing Is The New Outsourcing” And How To Demand A “LiLas (Lifelong Learning Account).”</p>

<p>Reading business book summaries is making me forget entirely what it was about business books that used to appeal to me. I remember stealing my dad’s business books when I was fourteen. They’re basically written at a middle school level. Something about finding a “blue ocean market” that nobody has touched yet. Kinda stupid. But then I started buying business books of my own! Case study after case study. Clever after clever. Smart after smart.</p>

<p>Something about vacation photography being a light form of work for travelers who can’t leave behind their desire to toil. Something about a fourteen year old shopping for business books??</p>

<p>All I know in life right now is that if a fourteen year old kid asked me for business books from a store I would say NO! You will spend the rest of your life grappling with this shit genre, kid. You know how they use Coke to remove blood from the highway? Imagine what it does to your stomach. Imagine what this does to a grownup executive. Imagine what this does to a kid. Using the feeling of being smart and clever and remembering how Seth Godin told you the world works <em>(...and it's not what you're thinking! Look inside for details ;-)</em> to remove blood from the highway.</p>

<p>Get a life. For if you don't, kid, you will spend the rest of your flight grappling with these book summaries.</p>

<p>I don’t know why I feel like I have to keep apologizing for saying that business books are entertaining reads. You have to think about it like [unconventional way]. Is it that the books are dumb and the people who read them are making themselves stupid and the people who write them might actually be smart?</p>

<p>These are the industry tips on which business leaders are operating? We are so fucked. So, so fucked.</p>

<p>I had always wondered, while watching TV or whatever, who proudly cuts the checks to produce horrible, horrible things. It’s funny to think about it that way, oblivious marketers and executives excited about their latest concept. But it hit me that sometimes, maybe often, in “business situations” the wheels start turning and nobody can stop them. The steady procession of a workflow is indifferent to anything but the appearance of progress. So instead of shaking my head at imaginary proud idiots with fat checkbooks, I imagined scared-anxious-bored people gritting their teeth as they push a new yogurt commercial out of door. Then going home to their families or a bar. It met business objectives or whatever! That’s closer to how I remember things actually working.</p>

<p>In this summary you will learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many phases did you go through?</li>
<li>Business books are such a shit genre.</li>
<li>At the tender age of fourteen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heading off for a solid month of vacation—the kind of time you can only have right after you sell the house and go online and pay off your debts and are obligated to no one for a while. "Time set aside for leisure" but my personal screen and You Will Spend The Rest Of Your Life Grappling, yes.</p>

   <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          
          
            <p>I installed <a href="http://satelliteeyes.tomtaylor.co.uk">Satellite Eyes</a> a month ago. It's a quiet little program by <a href="http://scraplab.net">Tom Taylor</a> that sets your desktop to a satellite view of where you're computing from whenever you open your laptop.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomtaylor/satellite-eyes">The source</a> was released on Github today! I thought about adding a feature that would allow your Satellite Eyes to save a trail of your maps as you move about. Then I realized that it already does this, incidentally, by keeping a cache. I dug through my cache (<code>~/Library/Application Support/Satellite Eyes/</code>) and found that I've connected in five unique places since installing it.</p>

<p>Granny and Grandpa's.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9brkgUCPN1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mom's.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9brksPvq31qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I've walked under that highway over and over again but never really pictured its shape. When I first saw this as my background it took me five minutes to figure out what that highway even <em>was</em>.</p>

<p>Dad's.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9brl47aSP1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Or at least I think this is Dad's. It looks like Manhattan, where the internet pipes come up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Hudson_Street">strange places</a>.</p>

<p>Inka's. (Helsinki!)</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9brlxnZCF1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tiina's. (<a href="http://suurpelto.fi/en/home.html">Suurpelto</a>)</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9brmk4yHy1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Suurpelto translates literally to "large field." Which makes sense if you look at this photo. But it's actually a futuristic housing development which, from my window, looks more like a construction site than a field.</p>

<p>Since you can't see it from space or street view yet I can describe it to you a little.</p>

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/47460788?title=0&#38;amp;byline=0&#38;amp;portrait=0&#38;amp;color=ffffff&#38;amp;loop=1" width="500" height="900" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>Since I shot this video, they've already put a fence up around that whole site in preparation for whatever comes next.</p>

<p>I actually don't know how to react to an optimistic development.</p>

<p>In New York it seems like when you're building a big planned something it always comes at the expense of old somethings. It feels profane to overwrite New York's chaotic emergence with any singular idea about architecture that wants to run too wide. (Tall is okay.) It's the real life version of <a href="http://themaninblue.com/experiment/Pixelfest/">that website where everyone can draw together but you're only allowed to color in one pixel at a time</a>. New York is even a grid. But people can't be bothered, in  New York, to collectively make pretty pictures, which some people might huff at but that's what I like best about it.</p>

<p>According the <em>The Atlantic</em>, as an American you have the undo some deeply ingrained Truths to understand how things work in Finland. I read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/12/what-americans-keep-ignoring-about-finlands-school-success/250564/">an article about the school system here</a> that said, "while Americans love to talk about competition...nothing makes Finns more uncomfortable. In his book Sahlberg quotes a line from Finnish writer named Samuli Paronen: &#38;lsquo;Real winners do not compete.&#38;rsquo; It's hard to think of a more un-American idea, but when it comes to education, Finland's success shows that the Finnish attitude might have merits." Anyway, because Finland is <a href="http://www.forest.fi/smyforest/foresteng.nsf/0/BE3C5576C911F822C2256F3100418AFD?Opendocument">86% forests</a> (and, as the joke goes, 14% lakes! <em>Also not sure what to think about a joke with a percentage point for a punchline.</em>) they have more to gain than lose by building big new developments.</p>

<p>So here on the large field they are drawing in swoops.</p>

<p>There will be no garbage trucks! Because they laid underground tubes before starting the houses. On the hour, from beneath the earth, comes the pneumatic whir of trash, compost, and recycling being sucked someplace far away, allegedly at 70 miles per hour.</p>

<p>There isn't a store yet. Maybe next year, in the middle of this photo.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9bv8ranZX1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A school will follow, if everything goes as planned.</p>

<p>Today a Finnish cover band played at a block party for residents. The creator of Angry Birds (which is equal parts <a href="http://www.treysmithblog.com/the-fall-of-angry-birds/">sooo over</a> and sooo Finnish, and which I previously had no opinion about but now decided I unconditionally love) was on hand to say a few words in Finnish (which I don't speak anymore) and cut the ribbon at a new Angry Birds playground for children.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9bv6akfG61qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Construction crews have descended and rows of buildings have been raised and block parties have been held and work continues from morning 'til night in the slow blink of the Satellite's Eye, so that Large Field™ still appears to be an actual large field. And I can't locate myself in the picture, not because I'm inept at reading these images, but because the satellite hasn't yet picked it up yet? You can build a city without getting caught?! Even if you catch it you won't understand it??</p>

            <p>Paper is like a scratch disk. In a less crowded place, I could've worked things out on paper and tucked it away or torn it up and felt satisfactorily defragmented. But I hate being watched. (Standing near somebody writing in a notebook on the train always excites my own surreptitious glance receptor.) So I needed to tap on my phone rather than write on paper.</p>

<p>Tapping is casual, habitual, discreet, modern. "Me? I'm just sending a long text!"</p>

<p>Today my computer is complaining that it's almost full. Text weighs nothing, but it reminds me that my scratch tappings accrue. That when I type or tap without thinking, I sometimes feel stronger anxiety than catharsis. That when I don't hit Post I feel heavy for no reason.</p>

<p>Should I even have tapped secrets into an antennaed thing? (Too late, the bits are definitely up there by now.)</p>

            <p>I wonder what airplanes were like before screens. I ask mom. She reminds me that before there were endless rows of screens—</p>

<p>the plane goes on and on it is three years old and has two whole floors passing through curtain after curtain into deeper realms of Economy traffic jams caused by impassable beverage carts it took us twenty minutes to travel from the front to the back</p>

<p>—there were just less screens. Oh yeah. Like taking the bus except with those two prong headphones that the airlines must've also realized make no sense because I haven't seen them in years. And barf bags.</p>

<p>Also they would bring you personal DVD players, like it was a present, if you were flying nice.</p>

<p>Or you could close your eyes.</p>

<p>Now everyone has their personal screen in the back of the seat in front of them.</p>

<p>I wonder when buses will have them too. The economics probably don’t make sense.</p>

<p>I wonder if customer satisfaction increased dramatically after ubiquitous screens everyone melting.</p>

<p>In the first five minutes after sitting down, the lady in front of us lifts herself up and turns around to let Niki know she has been kicking the lady's daughter’s seat. This made me a little scared of using the screen, because every time I would touch an onscreen button and the screen wouldn't respond and I'd have to touch it again and again or touch it harder and then try maybe holding it for a second or then counting to five or double tapping (to no avail) I would imagine the lady lifting and turning and asking me to stop tapping the lady's daughter’s seat. I would have to explain also indignantly that the screen is kind of broken sorry and the person behind me is doing the same thing to me and she’s probably doing it to the person in front of her sorry.</p>

<p>Picking up where <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/news/this-is-a-working-shop">Bridle</a> left off,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"But this is precisely what we cannot do with notional objects, software, code: we cannot linger before them. But can we imagine a way to do so?</p>
  
  <p>I’m going to code things to make code more visible, I’m going to print it out, project it, talk about it and interrogate it. And I’m going to do the same with ideas about craft and working with your hands. I’m not sure exactly where it’s going to go, but I’ll report back."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God I love this, but then there's the picture above of part of this project's instantiation. And it just set me off NO NO NO I don't want to linger in front of screens or projectors. Please god no. I <em>know</em> I already do, but.</p>

<p>There is a thread on Metafilter that I can't find anymore where everyone is trying to guess what will be totally unethical in a hundred years. For example: domesticated pets. Who puts their dog on a pole…like a stripper!</p>

<iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TCDbY_lXS5A?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>There were some other good things, but here is my guess: in 100 years light-emitting screens will be considered unethical! dangerous! downright stupid!</p>

<p>They have to change, they just have to. They will look back and laugh or maybe cry.</p>

<p>Who wants to spend time around screens? They're basically radioactive. This is stupid but I've come to feel this weird completely made up kinship with Marie Curie who I don't even know that much about except that she spent her days handling tubes of shit that poisoned her by osmosis, right?</p>

<p>Screens are so terrible that I'm convinced they've basically fueled this whole fucking Brooklyn Axe™ thing for the creative class that spends all day on their iMacs. I can't get into it right now because I'll lose my shit but this is a normal axe, you know, you buy it at a hardware store and it cuts things:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xa4z8CZI1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And this is a brooklyn axe. From the Summer Time 2009 collection ugh so five minutes ago!</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xa4pK2WK1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>You twirl it over your back and please make sure the blade is covered with its BESPOKE leather coozy so like no trees get hurt.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xa48shzQ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I live in brooklyn and can attest to the fact that I have no use for either of these things. But the brooklyn axe is suffused with this romance slash primal fantasy about going into work and fucking up your iMac with its antithesis. Or more likely just hanging upstate, in plaid. BUT THIS IS BESIDES THE POINT FUCK.</p>

<p>I used to come home from the office dreading looking at a screen for another second. But knowing that it's the only link to this crazy world.</p>

<p>Screens are spectacle, still. In public spaces you walk past screens and they ripple with their stupid lag to show that they're not just stickers.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hGIEjh-ZZcI?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Did you know you can browse the web on your Kindle? It works all around the world for free (which is so weird and unexpected) but more importantly it looks like nothing you've ever seen before to pull up Facebook through the lens of e-ink. I mean, it's a totally lame way to look at what's on screens: sans color, strobe-y refresh, slow and glitchy, a lacking contrast. But it's a revelation to not be shot in the face with light while reading.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xa9zgph81qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was on the beach a few days ago and there was this really unhappy woman near by who seemed like she was like getting a divorce from her husband from the way they were interacting, and everyone went to play in the water but she stayed on her towel squinting at her iPad in the glaring sun. And I kept looking over by accident when they were fighting, and then like staring really hard when I realized she was attempting to use an iPad in direct sunlight.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xaa5BGMi1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I broke my Kindle screen and never got a replacement and maybe that's why I have this pent up anger about being chained to a screen in Summer Time 2012. It REALLY REALLY doesn't work like this with the smiling. Sad people try to look at iPads in direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Screens and projectors are points of contention amongst artists working in computer world. How do you show art on computers in museums and galleries? Maybe this isn't a problem but a symptom of a larger problem.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6xb79h1LR1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I saw this show in the MoMA a few months ago it struck me for the first time that screens are soooo particular. Perhaps so 2012. It took until this setting, I think, to realize that screens are formal: intimate, glowing, radiating, private, tiring, electrifying, familiar, harsh, luminous.</p>

<p>I don't know how the future will work precisely. But looking at screens in shady places aaaaallllll the fuuckkkinnggg tiiiiiimeeeee isn't the way things have to be, it's just the way things are. I don't want to feel like I have to choose. In a hundred years people won't.</p>

            <p>Went to a show in a deli. By the time we arrived our friend's band had already played and left, so we bought lotto tickets from a vending machine and sat around for a while listening to random music.</p>

<hr />

<p>Had brunch with Alex. Did laundry and shuffled around Brooklyn all day. Ate whatever Korean food and watched Battle Royale. That was a day.</p>

<hr />

<p>Got to school to find art history was cancelled (again). Tried to organize my head and stratify out various projects and it was productive.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/23f873f0bd926e2aae4fdd026bbc7999/tumblr_inline_misu3caiD41qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went to the first of a six-part lecture series in the Great Hall by Steward Pickett called <a href="http://cooper.edu/about/news/cities-crisis-ecological-transformations">Cities in Crisis</a>. Really good boringinteresting environmentalism systems thinking. Incredibly well-researched. Drew a lot of parallels to the thing I was writing forever but waited too long to push out about new forms of administration and now will never finish. Specifically: He views cities not just as <em>the way things are</em>, but as the epitome of a certain period in time and one point along a trajectory or sequence. One piece of evidence to support this is that the UN taxonomies for cities (did you know they do that? I did not.) keep getting outgrown, leading to ever more ridiculous naming schemes: hypercities &#38;lt; megacities &#38;lt; supercities. Another interesting part was the difference between designing new cities  (which reminds me of  my time in <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/30197458348/why-havent-they-updated-that-photograph-of-the-whole">Suurpelto</a> this summer) and retrofitting existing ones. New cities are unburdened but sometimes lack resources. Old cities remind me of what we're doing with Cooper. Holland Cotter surprised me when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/arts/design/holland-cotter-weighs-the-best-art-shows-of-2012.html?adxnnl=1&#38;amp;pagewanted=all">he called it</a> a "forceful preservationist gesture". I hadn't really realized. I sometimes think it'd be more realistic to start over, but it was interesting to see the two contrasted.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/57a19202708981d34597035cb5306134/tumblr_inline_misu4bhw8J1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/763c595d3cbd05f25adcfca290f28dd7/tumblr_inline_misu4sxvae1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Between having juggled all my potential projects and tasks in my head and sitting through the long boringinteresting lecture my head felt really full. Got drinks with Jo and Alex, then very efficiently went to Student Council, where I showed off lots of website updates AND another meeting about creatively fucking with the administration's boring Peter Cooper birthday party the next day, before meeting back up with them for burgers in Brooklyn.</p>

<hr />

<p>Woke up really early without an alarm or anything. Biked to school to get ready. Lots of ideas which seemed unrealistic had been tossed around the previous night but most of the good ones were actually coming into existence. Sprayed a lock-in clock on my shirt, painted a hastily-lettered sign, and headed downstairs with bushels of stenciled heart balloons and a Happy Resignation Jamshed cake hidden beneath a cloth. A couple people hoisted the giant Free Education To All banner up between two trees in the park just as the ceremony began.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/9a06a83ba2b61209bcc18ee841dd9eee/tumblr_inline_mistagHxUi1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we all waited, balloons in hand, for their stupid ceremonies to conclude. At which point Pete began to LOUDLY mic-check a Peter Cooper quote about trustees not being allowed to amass debt...back in the day. Our people managed to toss a red wreath on top of the administration's, then we followed the procession into the colonnade while mic-checking the <a href="http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/02/01/art-faculty-letter/">Art Faculty's letter</a>. There was a little bit of an intense moment of slowly marching towards administrators eating birthday cake while shouting the faculty letter at the top of our lungs. Joe presented Jamshed with the cake as, finally, the SFAFCU demands were mic-checked, ending with "3) Jamshed Bharucha steps down."</p>

<p>A long, quiet pause. The air was charged.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/742a3cf6582441185306e3c5be6bc0cc/tumblr_inline_mist9sIYbr1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, singing: "Happy resignation to youuuuuu, happy res-ig-nationnnn to youuuu, happy resig-NA-tion dear Jamshed—"</p>

<p>Which is when Jamshed raised his hand like Britney shielding herself from paparazzi or something and walked out — mid-song! — to the elevator. When the song was over it was dead silent and NOT SO FUN ANYMORE and everybody looked around like DID THAT HAPPEN. The balloon holders went outside for a second before determining that we'd cut the cake in the lobby outside Jamshed's office and release the balloons there. So, basically, everything went off without a hitch.</p>

<p><a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/43053299155/today-coopers-board-of-trustees-and-president">Blogged about it</a> later.</p>

<p>I was a few minutes late to projects. I kept falling asleep. It was boring and frustrating. Left early because I thought I was gonna black out…and then I did on the sleeping bag on the floor of my studio. Biked back to Brooklyn, and went to the new Greenpoint X'ian which feels like an inside joke because it's so small and close to nothing except home.</p>

<hr />

<p>We had a long weekend, so Wednesday became a Friday. "Friday" the 13th.</p>

<p>Went to Dennis's class in the morning. Still felt shitty. Couldn't focus on art.</p>

<p>Slept on the floor of my studio again.</p>

<p>Talked to the advisement office about getting out of my Bio class and Joyce said basically no, I won't get a diploma. I'm indifferent about that anyway after having assessed the risk of getting my diploma yanked for the lock-in and concluding that it actually is just a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Got to Bio late and it was as insufferable as I expected. Haven't felt like I'm just sitting in a room watching the clock since high school. It's slightly better than high school because I can be on my laptop. Emailed Day from inside the class that I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS CLASS. Scheduled to meet her on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Then, up popped an email from Jamshed, explaining that the Executive Committee of the Board has decided to withdraw all early admissions for the School of Art.</p>

<p>What the fuck.</p>

<p>Immediately started pinging back and forth with Free Cooper people.</p>

<p>Having felt shitty for a couple days in a row, I'd planned to head to the suburbs to recuperate. But suddenly was organizing an emergency meeting about responding to this newsbomb.</p>

<p>It was the biggest turnout at any kind of meeting in a long time. But nobody really knew what to do. There was a little bit of getting on the same page and speculating and it kind of devolved into creative action planning which may or may not be realistic or helpful right now. Like DIG PETER COOPER UP FORM HIS GRAVE AND BRING HIM HERE. I think I kept waving my arms around and saying things like "SELF-ORGANIZE". Which also may or may not be helpful. Anyway, when that was done I fled directly from school to the suburbs.</p>

<hr />

<p>Spent the next FIVE days at home. Pounded Zicam and Nyquil, slept, had alone time, and hung out with family until I was better-ish.</p>

<p>I was actually so in need of going home that I didn't even pack a bag, so on Friday Niki drove me to the store and I bought socks and underwear lol.</p>

<p>That night the New York Times article that had been in the works dropped. The headline: damaging. "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/nyregion/cooper-unions-tradition-of-free-tuition-may-be-near-end.html?pagewanted=all">Free Tuition at Cooper Union May Be Near End</a>".</p>

<p>The article: fair. I was happy to see Kerry and Buckley quoted. Also, I can now add to my resume that <em>The New York Times</em> has called me, "a terrible but amusing rapper". OR just "terrible". Jesus Christ. They weren't supposed to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhowml0sBBI&#38;amp;list=UUn4Pi8yIH4YQKlNyHcyBAgA&#38;amp;index=1">see that</a>. But they LINKED TO IT. An even bigger victory was that the NYT linked to Student Council's meeting notes(!) AND fucking called the Attorney General to verify a vague threat Jamshed had made to faculty about the school being closed down for insolvency.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; At a meeting last month with the art faculty, someone asked Dr. Bharucha what might happen if professors refused to go along with the board’s plans. His response, <a href="http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/01/29/art-faculty-dean-jamshed-kristi/">according to minutes</a> of that meeting: “The attorney general would ask us to close.” (Dr. Bharucha said he did not recall making the statement; a spokesman for the attorney general said it has made no such warnings.)</p>

<p>Sorrrrrry bout it, we got it in writing. I had a hunch that meeting notes would eventually blow up if done right, and these proved to, both internally and in the media. Couldn't be more psyched.</p>

<p>Joe and I collated some recent and missing press in a Google Sheet and I figured out how to use <a href="https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop">Tabletop</a> to syndicate that out <a href="http://cusos.org/press">wherever</a> as HTML.</p>

<p>Made a stupid little thing called <a href="http://cooperunion.info/showdown">Cooper Media Showdown</a> contrasting "our" media attention versus "theirs". Not only do we have more volume, but all their press is fucking depressing, while ours is generally hopeful in spite of confronting tough issues rather than just bowing to them.</p>

<p>Got a kooky idea about doing sentiment analysis on all of our press.</p>

<p>Cooper media is a decent corpus and it's something to potentially carry into my own writing and reading projects stuff. Texts spun around by the electric brain.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/02308aff2f8b592d7872459c3eee28b2/tumblr_inline_missq2rBC01qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, the electric brain is fucking stupid! Figured out how to extract text using <a href="https://www.readability.com/developers/api/parser">Readability</a>, get <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com">Alchemy</a> to spit out <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/entity/sentiment.html">ranked entities with sentiment scores</a>, and then render that JSON as a d3.js approval matrix. Buggy and really stupid (because computers REALLY REALLY can't understand things) but fun to have quickly whipped up. I'm at a frustrating place in terms of code fluency where I can generally get things to work in pieces but not know how to glue them all together. Ideally a computer would scrape all the articles into a database, run sentiment analysis, maybe even MTurk it or collect human input as well, feed that into the D3 graph, and there would be some kind of interface for switching between articles or overlaying their results or understanding the data in different ways. Each of those little parts was its own struggle, so tying them together is intimidating. Basically I was deep in a text editor copying and pasting urls and manually writing JSON and stuff, which is doofy.</p>

<p>Went to the mall with Mom and Niki which was fun and so suburban. Tried on stupid hats.</p>

<p>Answered a few emails, finally, carving away at the looming cloud of tasks I will never get to. Spent the rest of Monday doing nothing and wanting to not return to reality.</p>

<p>Decided I couldn't do more meetings, so missed Student Council. Got back into Brooklyn late.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overslept the followup to the explosive faculty meeting oops. But secretly glad to miss another meeting and felt good knowing two other notetakers would be there to corroborate. Stayed in Brooklyn and made some graphics to promote a rally for deferred students that Victoria had almost singlehandedly organized over the weekend.</p>

<p>Kevin wrote an awesome <a href="http://slavin.tumblr.com/post/43504179911/if-youre-just-joining-the-cooper-union-story-the">blog post</a> about it:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; It’s possible that Cooper Union has reached the end of the line, and can’t bring in students because it can no longer subsidize the education that Peter Cooper worked to provide. But if that’s the case: say so.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; If it’s not the case, say yes or no. “Deferral” is a bureaucrat’s word. These are students, and at 17, they still speak English; they understand yes and no. None of this could possibly make any sense to them, as it certainly doesn’t make sense to a lot of other people.</p>

<p>Projects was less bad than usual but not great. Feeling very out of the requisite headspace for my classes lately. Made some weird drawings and notes.</p>

<p>Met with Day and told her I promised myself I wouldn't bullshit after high school, and she told me I could definitely drop the Bio class if I wanted to and just take a summer class to make up for it, I just wouldn't get a diploma at graduation. Which is hilarious because that happened to me in high school over skipping gym. I decided, weirdly enough because she seemed so whutevs about it, that I'd probably tough it out. I definitely don't want to pay for some shitty summer class in Bio after I graduate. Also talked Cooper stuff and she lent me a book I'd been eyeing, <em>The Fall of the Faculty and the Rise of the All Administrative University</em>. Good to talk to Day, always.</p>

<p>There was a meeting to prep for the rally but I was feeling bad so I went home.</p>

<hr />

<p>Woke up and one of my legs was freezing cold and wet. The radiator in the apartment above me had given out and was leaking directly onto my bed...again. I've only had my sheets back for a month since coming home from break and finding them completely crusty with radiator water. Hope my tetanus shot covers this.</p>

<p>Put a bowl on my bed to catch the drips, made a cup of tea, and read the last chapter of <em>Fall of the Faculty</em>, skimming the rest. Its suggestions were consistent with the stuff I'd been writing on forms of administration: get rid of administrators that don't appear to have a purpose, put faculty on the board, etc. It was interesting to note somebody else's observation of apathy or frustration with shared governance. For example, some of this guy's colleagues opted out of all faculty governance meetings and made a point of writing a book during those times. The book did well and everybody was slightly jealous, but if people don't suck it up and share the responsibility of unsexy administrative work it will get packaged into somebody else's job, and then you'll be sorry. (That's why I'm super interested in how tools can make meetings less frequent and better. I actually have a high tolerance for sharing those responsibilities, but hate to see others opt-out and hate to see myself burn out a little.) Most of all, I didn't even realize how bad some places have it, with HUNDREDS of "deanlets". Cooper is smalllll in comparison and should therefore be pliable. But damn it's hard.</p>

<p>Worked on revising our <a href="http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/02/13/bharucha-response/">Art Student Council response to Jamshed's letter</a>. It was fun to watch it get written by five different people on Github. (<a href="https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commits/master/_posts/notes/2013-02-13-bharucha-response.md">IT'S WORKING</a>.) Then committed and emailed it off at the last minute and rushed to school for the rally.</p>

<p>It drew a big crowd and the poorly amplified statements read by and on behalf of applicants were totally moving.</p>

<p>I was excited to see Niki and Rina! Despite cold weather, a big success. Especially in terms of generating press:</p>

<p>Went to a Contemporary Art Issues class taught by <a href="http://artstarstv.com/post/21143426887/curator-porn-documenta-13-and-the-press-kit-from">Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev</a>, which was amusing ("I am NOT a curator. I don't know what contemporary is, I don't know what art is, and I definitely don't what issues are. I've been researching research for 30 years!") in a way that will probably just turn boring soon.</p>

<p>Then, unfortunately, a PR blast that was sent out 30 minutes into our rally patronizing the community for allegedly, "taking the high road off a cliff" started to show up in press as an official response. Dashed off a quick <a href="http://cusos.org/response-to-135pm-statement-from-claire-mccarthy-to-press/">line-by-line refutation</a> of their garbage and made it to another weirdly just okay — in terms of where my head is at — class, thirty minutes late.</p>

<hr />

<p>Saskia wanted to meet in the morning to give me a slap on the wrist for being pictured in the media with this sign.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/75d94071bfd17110ef104ef74d21d343/tumblr_inline_missxbW2fS1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess it's not smart to undermine all the research and reading I've actually done with a guesstimation, but I didn't make the sign and Jamshed's salary isn't actually public information, so I'll probably issue a Photoshop correction when the 990s come out.</p>

<p>Had a boring Seth class where we critted Aaron and Will.</p>

<p>This blog post by Cindy Milstein, <a href="http://cbmilstein.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/organizing-as-if-social-relations-matter/">Organizing As If Social Relations Matter</a>, made my day. In fact, it retroactively made my past couple of weeks. Or two years even. I almost cried when I read it because in spite of its hippy-ness it touches on the human side of what we're doing that isn't just about a goal. This shit takes too much time and feels like a rollercoaster — in the words of the Carolyn, "it's hard to live when you're under siege"…tell me about it. — but it means something.</p>

<hr />

<p>A boring Dennis class. What is with me? A boring bio class…that's to be expected.</p>

<p>Then something awesome: Cooper Happy Hour. People from a bunch of different parties who haven't worked together closely before in a meaningful way coming together to clarify and amplify each others messages and get new shit done. Some people want to remain anonymous, some people want to come out of anonymity. It's an interesting dynamic, a stellar group, and I think we're gonna do some crazy shit. I'm not used to non-class meetings with badass adults. Brain, shaken.</p>

<p>That was followed by a fun party on the third floor by the architecture school. Of course they played the video which I will never live down oh my god.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>.@<a href="https://twitter.com/caseyg">caseyg</a> and co.'s sexy @<a href="https://twitter.com/cooperunion">cooperunion</a> taskforce video on the big Hejduk screen @ the School of Architecture's party <a href="http://t.co/D9EgceKKXa" title="http://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/305156781561237506/photo/1">twitter.com/FreeCooperUnio…</a></p>     <div><a href="https://twitter.com/FreeCooperUnion/status/305156781561237506">February 23, 2013</a></div></blockquote>

<p>Hung around in the East Village 'til late.</p>

<hr />

<p>Woke up just in time to scramble out the door into the crappy weather to catch a series of busses to Victoria and Stefan's house for a three or four session facilitation training that Stefan is offering. I didn't take notes but learned a lot. It's pretty crazy how there is such significant overlap between activist/consensus type people and corporate team-building and structures. I was reminded a lot of when I used to work with a project manager, except when I was working there wasn't the same sense of purpose in the day-to-day. We started by stretching and breathing and stuff — it can get hokey! — and then tried to answer basic questions like: why do groups of humans ever meet at all? What could the word facilitator mean? Could draw parallels, at some point, to this stuff online in terms of moderation. But it also underscores the importance of <a href="http://www.smith.edu/events/commencement_speech2008.php">breath-based eye-to-eye</a> meeting, even as an end in itself. But, of course, the purpose is to help large unwieldy groups trust each other and accomplish goals. It's especially hard and important for me because I've always been overly loud and aggressive, so going through this with some quieter people is really instructive. I might not, in the end, make a good facilitator because I'm usually pretty impassioned, but knowing this stuff will I think even help be a part of meetings. Not that we even need it here, right now or yet, but I could see this eventually being really useful.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/5506b314b6787639eb4bfaf5192ab562/tumblr_inline_mist0uhAuZ1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the meeting, set up some infrastructure for Happy Hour with V and bounced ideas off her about publishing that group's work on Github. It's hard-ish compared to traditional methods but I'm determined, for many reasons, to make it work.</p>

<p>Headed to Dad's and we went from there with Niki to dinner. Don't think I've seen him in a month! He's been traveling. Thank god sometimes for parents nearby who will buy you dinners otherwise out of your reach. Sometimes it's boring to be around each other because we're similar in that we're both very much in our own heads and worlds that don't overlap all the much, but we started talking about Cooper and he had a ton of interesting advice. In the Happy Hour meeting it was brought up that we not only have to get our messages out there, but see how they land. So it was interesting to hear which parts resonated with him and what he thinks next steps should be. It's easy to forget that some of the internal politics and bad governance stuff doesn't really come across. Also, a tag line that we had all gotten psyched about made no sense to him, which was worrying but I'm glad I figured out.</p>

<p>Returned to Brooklyn all excited from a day, or really a few weeks, of charging forward with lots of different Cooper stuff and juggling it all without dropping the ball. It's easy to feel like it's some kind of distraction that I need to compress into smaller amounts of time, but when I take it seriously it feels great.</p>

<hr />

<p>Did laundry. Hung around and tried to blog. It's HARD to focus and justify spending a ridiculous amount of time on something so vain and trivial but like commitments-to-self and brain-defragmentation or whatever. Kind of a nothing day. Stayed up late with Aaron and Alex. It was a full moon and we guessed it. Aaron finally pointed out to me that when I was away for five days a week ago they had all flipped the entire contents of my bookshelf so the pages face outward and I hadn't noticed. Psychopaths! Fell asleep while resting my eyes in the middle of blogging.</p>

<hr />

<p>Overslept art history. Oops, christ. It's kind of a nothing class anyway. Scared that I'm SLIGHTLY withdrawn from my classes at the moment, but sometimes it happens. Tectonic brain plates shifting. My fear of political art, on top of my fear of regular art. I was talking to Aaron about how I'm PROBABLY going to make a shitload of ART when I get out of school because I won't have crits and a 10,000 page invisible book of unwritten rules to abide by. Aspirational.</p>

<p>And on the subject of aspirations, had a beer with Alex AT 11 AM because it's like well, already fucked this day up I love college lol yolooooo. MOM, it was merely symbolic and we all made it to school shortly after where I have been happily/diligently blogging my heart out/the day away ever since.</p>

<p>Tonight, New York is an embarrassment of riches and I will have to choose between: part three of Pickett's lectures on Cities in Crisis, a guy from NASA talking about the Mars rover, a screening at MoMA of a movie by the Otolith group that I was told I HAVE to see one time when I missed it to infiltrate Cooper's telemarketing department. Or, you know, doing work. Which is the only thing I actually have to be doing right now. Fuck New York sometimes. I'll <del>sleep when I'm dead</del> do my work when I live alone in a corn field. OKAY?</p>

            <p>Tuesday evening:</p>

<ul>
<li>Briefly saw very crowded openings at school.</li>
<li>Last time I saw Katie before she moves to Boston 😭.</li>
<li>Biked over the bridge really fast to drinks with a bunch of old coworkers. It's been a long time since I quit my job. They're pretty much all off being CEOs of stealth startups now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wednesday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Woke up late and did nothing all day. Like read <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3932048/blackberry-announces-alicia-keys-as-global-creative-director">Alicia Keys</a> <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/a-brief-history-of-alicia-keys-using-phones-other">syngergy news</a>.</li>
<li>Received an email from my pal Lawrence in administration saying, "In order to meet the information dissemination and posting needs of the Cooper Union community, the Posting Policy has been updated." Followed by an 800-word long set of rules in six sections basically declaring that unapproved posters are banned at Cooper from now on. So I solicited new entries to <a href="http://cooperunion.info/posters">cooperunion.info/posters</a> and threw together a little poster of my own that I have to plaster up soon. Information dissemination and posting needs? This is what administrative busywork and micromanagement looks like.</li>

<li>By the time I biked to school just in time for sculpture I heard it had been cancelled.</li>
<li>Walked around the LES with Aaron and ended up at Mission Chinese which was spicy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thursday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biked to the Bruce space for drawing, which is a nice place. There was sort of nothing to do and no work to look at yet so we just talked slowly for a long time about whatever.</li>
<li>Went to school. Figured out <a href="http://www.jongware.com/markdownid.html">how to pull Markdown into InDesign</a>. Messed around with the <a href="http://github.com/caseyg/bylaws">Bylaws</a> trying to figure out a continuous horizontal diff of the five versions, but it felt slow, finicky, and kind of like something I should teach a computer to do. But that didn't seem immediately doable, so I just plotted all the bylaws next to each other on a giant sheet of paper (42 in tall) and started diffing by hand in my studio with markers, using <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com">Kaleidoscope</a> as a reference.</li>

<li>I was Instagramming while I worked and Inka joked that it looked like a conspiracy theory, which reminded me of this awesome bit from <a href="https://readmill.com/CaseyG/reads/understanding-power-the-indispensible-chomsky">Chomsky</a>.</li>

<li>"It's just normal institutional analysis, the kind of analysis you do automatically when you're trying to understand how the world works." Yup.</li>
<li>Biked home at 2am when I was done. It's easier to stay late when I don't have to think about the subway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Friday:</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/7e167ea91b0643c93ba6b9242045d18e/tumblr_inline_mhx6w7Cu7Q1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></li>
<li>That's a thumbnail of the final diff, here is a <a href="https://raw.github.com/caseyg/bylaws/master/img/markerdiff-large.jpg">readable-sized version</a>. It looks all fucked up because I had to cut it into scanner sized pieces for <a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/note/flip-flop/">re-digitization</a>.</li>
<li>Showed the diff (before cutting it up) in Dennis's class. We talked about the actual content of the document. People had questions. I pointed some things out. Joe seemed disappointed that I hadn't found a smoking gun and thought that a synthesis would be a more useful form. Probably true. Mark Lombardi was brought up. Which means I am now going to go back in time and kill Mark Lombardi so that he stops showing up in all my crits. I don’t think I was trying to make art but if I wasn't showing a governance document inside the same institution it might be more aesthetic. Like Lombardi.</li>
<li>Porter showed some white frame things. Joe showed his show.</li>
<li>Then we had our Student Judiciary trial for the lock-in. Here we are huddling and looking over documents before going in:</li>
<li><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/a969230470a9f3fc31b6c16049f740ed/tumblr_inline_mhx1bx9nkw1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="trial" /></li>
<li>It was actually really fun to sit with fellow-students and go over the facts and be reminded how in-the-right we were about the actions we took and the degree to which we thought things through.</li>
<li>Bio was boring. Ate peanuts in the back of the room and spaced out. Got a text from Jakob that our punishment is…a seven day ban from the round elevator. LOL, YES. Students effectively dropped the administration's case against us while still humoring them. Left class as soon as it was over to retrieve my formal letter:</li>
<li><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/59c32e0b7ab2cb19c98b53d0d5fb28ce/tumblr_inline_mhx1by5xdI1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="letter" /></li>
<li>That evening the Art Faculty circulated by email <a href="http://cusos.org/cooper-union-art-faculty-vote-to-reject-tuition/">the most beautiful fucking letter</a> which they had presented to the President a week earlier, rejecting any tuition based plans at Cooper. I was sitting alone at my computer, but literally started clapping and making weird little involuntary noises. This is a huge milestone on the Free Cooper front. Anybody can scream and you can block them out, but when 1/3 of your faculty mutinies, you listen. Spread it around on social media.</li>
<li>Went to a party at our Neighbors with Tyler. Walked around our reverse apartment for a while just looking at how differently they'd decorated it.</li>
<li>Left for karaoke and pizza.</li>
</ul>

<p>Saturday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pushed the faculty letter out to press. It's fun having a kind of workflow post-lock-in for getting anything we want to say out there. Feels easier than I would've thought before.</li>
<li>Went to a gross party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sunday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biked up to Gramercy for brunch with old friends. Funny hearing about their jobs. JOBS. Made me more ready than ever to go OFF THE GRID.</li>
</ul>

<p>Monday:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Art History listened to an engineer present about Dali and Surrealism. Which made me wonder what I would sound like talking to engineers about thermodynamics. That should happen more.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2013-02-04/cooper-union-faculty-opposes-tuition-based-programs/">Art in America</a> picked up on the faculty letter. Posted it up around school with Jamshed faces which were quickly removed per the new posting policy.</li>
<li>Kristi posted <a href="http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/01/29/art-faculty-dean-jamshed-kristi/">notes from the letter presentation meeting</a> with faculty and Bharucha. They were widely shared. Even Village Voice picked up on them. I had a hunch when I got involved with Student Council and convinced everyone to start throwing notes from everything on Github that people would go nuts for real transparency, like meeting notes, however boring that sounds. This confirmed that. Haven't seen so many people engaged in a while.</li>
<li>Met Galen for coffee. We first met when he ran up to me at school and said somebody had told him to talk to me and I should read a book by Marvin Minsky. Which I did half-read and still think about. So we've stayed in touch. We rambled about a lot about things we’re working on. He said something I don't hear around here a lot, which is that this place overrates individual geniuses and it might not be so bad to step out of that game for a while. </li>
<li>Almost walked into traffic for like the fourth time that day.</li>
<li>Had a nice dinner with Alex and Tyler for no reason, so was perfectly late to Student Council. My secret goal with <a href="http://cooperasc.github.com/notes">the notes</a> is to go to less meetings. But the meeting was kinda rad, we basically changed the annoyingly formal mission statement to: "We're a group of art students. We're whatever the student body needs their presence within the existing bureaucratic structure at Cooper to be. We go to meetings, take notes which we share, and vote on behalf of students. The school gives us money to throw parties."</li>
<li>Ranted a little in my <a href="http://github.com/caseyg/projects/wiki">projects wiki</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tuesday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Woke up early. Tiptoed into Alex's room and took his blazer. Dressed a little fancy.</li>
<li>Stopped to buy a legal pad on the way to school.</li>
<li>Met Kristi on the 7th floor and we took the stairs up to the Peter Cooper Suite for the follow-up meeting between art faculty, Bharucha, and three trustees(!). The fact that they decided to show up means things are escalating sufficiently. The meeting was exciting but exhausting. Maybe because I was taking notes as fast as I could the entire time.</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/02/cooper_union_art_faculty.php">Village Voice</a> picked up the faculty letter.</li>
<li>I showed Walid my wiki and the diff before the meeting on his iPad because we were sitting next to each other. I think he called revisions the saddest thing ever. Like how you always feel you need the palimpsest and have to reduce thresholds for memory to a keystroke. Giving equivalence to everything's entire history. I was like, hmm yeah I guess...so what?</li>
<li>Then had his class. I was sleepy and bored. We all talked for a long time in a way that didn’t really make sense to me about my wiki. Which, to be fair, isn't really anything to talk about yet. And I had no idea what to say, only that in retrospect I am glad I didn’t write a "grant proposal". We argued about artists' writing. Which for me is also complicated. When you do things that involve writing, what’s your work and what’s your meta-writing? I have a feeling there’s no distinction for me. Next week he wants bios from everyone. I thought of my <a href="http://caseyagollan.com">graph</a> as my bio. Walid says writing proposals and bios isn't just being complicit with the system of curators and biennials and whatnot. Probably the biggest mindfuck since MWB.</li>
<li>Blacked out on the floor of my studio for an hour. I can't believe, at this point in time, that I was ever really into the idea of studio furniture or the idea of taller ceilings bigger thoughts or this dream of building a house completely along desire lines. Sleeping on the floor for a week during the lock-in crushed any vestigial remnants of my interest in how bourgeois chairs help you think.</li>
<li>Dan had an extra ticket to a fancy alumni event so I met him there to haunt administrators with my presence and drink martinis.</li>
<li>Jam: "you know, I make a mean martini. I'll make you one." Me: "I'll come up to your office and we'll have some martinis" Jam: "no we can't do that, but you can certainly come over to the house and I'll make you one, as long as you promise to not occupy my home!" Me: "😇"</li>
<li>Lawrence: "what are you going to use this photo for?"</li>
<li><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/b6336e12d9c130c34fa704b6a8eac2f3/tumblr_inline_mhx1bkgfsM1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="lawrence" /></li>
</ul>

<p>Wednesday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Even my shit smells like martinis.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.artforum.com/news/page_id=0#news39293">Artforum</a> picks up the faculty letter.</li>
<li>Tyler, Audrey, Aaron showed in Niki's. She was kind of on fire. Said some really good stuff. Bowed to non-sequiturs.</li>
<li><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/db68b40c1bf7598b4007eef53ab466f9/tumblr_inline_mhx1aajl8P1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="niki" /></li>
<li>Talked about student council’s notes/transparency project with Kristi, who was apprehensive about posting her notes after having been approached all week by students, faculty, and reporters. I'm happy she's thinking deeply about implications and best practices and misrepresentation and responsibility because my priority has been moving fast. It's a good combination and I feel like we're going to come out of this with something like Flickr’s Community Guidelines, but for Institutional Transparency(!).</li>
<li>Spent a bunch of hours cross-checking Kristi's notes against my own, which I agreed to do before publicizing them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thursday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Had Seth in the morning. Dilan and Kristi showed. Couldn't stop staring out the skylights at the monolith across the street where a lone construction worker was jumping up and down on a sheet of glass facade to slide it into place.</li>
<li>Released <a href="http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/02/05/resident-faculty-president-and-trustee-meeting/">more notes</a>. I've heard nothing but concerns about open meeting notes, but in practice have seen only widespread excitement and involvement.</li>
<li>Worked on making the student council site less barebones, now that we've been using it a bunch.</li>
<li>Watched William Wegman videos with Aaron and Tyler for a bit. They're great.</li>
</ul>

<p>Friday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overslept Dennis. I was TOLD there would be a blizzard, so I stayed home, even though it didn't start snowing until later, because I was in no mood for my high school-ish bio class. Kinda burned out. Read a chapter from How To Be Idle which is kind of my bible/most important reference book. It's hard to tell if it’s ruining or making my life. Attempted to blog but couldn’t really get much of anything done. Hung out at home. Watched SVU, Spongebob, and Godard with Alex and Jo. They were all exactly the same. Went to bed at a reasonable hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Saturday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jackson Heights for Indian with Aaron and Tyler.</li>
<li>Aaron and Tyler making fun of me for blogging my life until I lost my will to live, let along blog about it. Pretty good impersonations of me having revelatory moments tho.</li>
<li>Saw the World's Fair Globe and gigantic Robert-Moses-commissioned model of NYC. Reminded me of Seeing Like a State.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Weeknotes again. Here we go…!</p>

<p>I got back to Brooklyn on Saturday to find that my ceiling had fallen into my bed.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/9152134b7706a71d2850f870198bea53/tumblr_inline_mhcvie4W361qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Presented the laundromat with the most gigantic crusty ambiguous stain ever, preemptively babbling about radiators-and-how-its-like-not-blood-or-body-fluids-I-swear, but then got the weird suspicion that they wouldn't care if it was and then spent the rest of the day wondering if that's just like a thing they deal with all the time and if there's an SVU episode in there for me to write.</p>

<p>Anyway, like the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/caseygollanbusinesscoaching">other Casey Gollan</a> always says:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/c8af2db4c579b314dc8cbb888bab2935/tumblr_inline_mhcvijQLg31qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Got the cheap ($5!) shitty bike of my dreams from mom for christmas. Bought a helmet and lock.</p>

<p>Biked to Manhattan and back for a meeting about working for free. Biked home fast.</p>

<p>Realized how much getting a bike is like getting a dog, namely that you hate people who have dogs and bikes for being so annoying about it until you get a bike and suddenly everyone who you used to be able to make fun of bikers with now despises your cooing.</p>

<p>Felt bored so I IM'd every Facebook friend that was online at the same time. This is the best use of Facebook I've found since <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3476431434206.2127513.1373820023&#38;amp;type=1&#38;amp;l=0cc23946db">uploading an entire book</a>. You feel like you are FLYING slash trying to man all the phones in a busy call center and then people come over because nobody's doing anything on Facebook anyway and you just like rip all the paintings off the wall in excitement.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/0e5fa82912008479cf7640e98ad005e2/tumblr_inline_mhcwj1G13y1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then it was Martin Luther King Jr. Day and I read <a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/voices-in-time/martin-luther-king-jr-lances-a-pus-flowing-boil.php?page=all">some of his writing</a>:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; "I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advised the Negro to wait until a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."</p>

<p>And in my head I couldn't stop thinking about a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.</p>

<p>I was also chewing on this part:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; "I hope you can see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law as the rabid segregationist would do. This would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do it, openly, lovingly (not hatefully as the white mothers did in New Orleans when they were seen on television screaming, “nigger, nigger, nigger”), and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust—and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice—is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law."</p>

<p>I had just read the <a href="http://pastebin.com/3i9JRJEA">Guerilla Open Access Cookbook</a>, which has some good parts like:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; "We must abandon the image of the lone hacker as the symbol of our movement and recognize that any successful guerilla movement depends on the work of people filling many different roles.</p>

<p>But it also deals a lot, in part through that distribution of roles, with working around a system without getting caught. "It is unwise to be an open voice for radical illegal action and also its agent." This seems to go against MLK's public stoic acceptance of penalties and reverence for <em>just</em> laws. I was reading the GOA Cookbook, of course, in the aftermath of Aaron Swartz's suicide, which I at first observed as cautiously separated-out from his legal troubles…and then saw it definitively smashed together. So it's confusing, how laws can crush people and if they should stand up or be covert.</p>

<p>Other good MLK things:</p>

<p>This quote about fixing systems, or as he so eloquently puts it: restructuring edifices that produce injustice…in the name of compassion!</p>

<p>&#38;gt; "A true revolution of value will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies...True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it understands that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth"</p>

<p>And, on politicians watering things down, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96d_CzrfxsM">Cornel West Explains Why It Bothers Him That Obama Will Be Taking The Oath With MLK's Bible</a>:</p>

<iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/96d_CzrfxsM" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>It's in the back of my head to read and watch more MLK soon.</p>

<p>But then, a stream of <a href="http://dld-conference.com/events/479">the worst panel I've ever seen</a> came on and Aaron and I watched people our age bloviate about their artistic practices. The theme of the panel was: born before 1989. AND YET everyone had founded some sort of Institute legitimizing their practice. More than once, images of NOTHING, like a cardboard box, would appear on screen and the speaker would explain, "This is a project on sustainable networked shelter interventions deployed throughout blah blah blah." Another panelist explained a group they had founded which releases research reports about technology and commerce, dropping brand names like FIT BIT but apparently using, "imaginary data from our wrist bands that didn't work". Or something.</p>

<p>I don't. Even know.</p>

<p>I could probably argue the flip side of this: that speculative projects are actually really exciting because being young you don't have resources to like actually do certain kinds of stuff and you don't need to anyway if you can think about it, render it, and share it, and how it's both possible and relevant for young artists to pretend to be institutions because on the internet nobody knows you're a DOG. That's plausible.</p>

<p>It's more plausible, however, that International Art English enables anyone who has been through art school to EXPLAIN to a room of people who travel on global conference and art world circuits how a cut up cardboard box is mind-blowingly subversive and provocative. The part that I guess made me sour besides boring work tinted by art-professional-ism, was the youth-exploitation-factor behind curators presenting "the next generation to watch out for".</p>

<p>I had responded to a vague request from these same people over break, not really knowing what it was about. But watching the stream put in me a mood to SALT THE EARTH. So, in a rage blackout I <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/293453221735849986">wrote</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/293453539714424832">a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/293454955463966723">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/293455811466899456">angry</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/293456031437168644">tweets</a> and sent this NOT A THREAT I SWEAR email.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d2f20640e6e1c8c8b68e8feeba2d35b0/tumblr_inline_mhcsglR9xm1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Even if I burn all the bridges in the world I will probably still end up on a panel talking about my godforsaken keywords: "system design, software studies, trolling, activism, and idleness." I cringe now looking at the bio I sent them…</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Casey Gollan was born in 1991 in Los Angeles, California. He lives in New York where he is about to finish studying at Cooper Union — if the administration decides to grant him a degree after all the trouble he’s caused them.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; His work crosses wires between autobiographical writing, system design, software studies, trolling, activism, and idleness. He has written about software as politics for Rhizome.org and post-internet art for Pooool.info.</p>

<p>SO LIKE why did I write that?! It's painful to gauge my own amount of hot air (90%?) and think about the lame industries which lay ahead: panel discussions and curators and writers who want to be published.</p>

<p><a href="http://89plus.com">Other people's</a> KEYWORDS: liminal identities, the intersection of gender, religion, and technology in the Gulf, Amazonian jungle in relation to the ones that wonder too deep, the pedantic qualities of the Broadcast as a language, class differences, social stratification, cultural capital, class imitation and seduction, hierarchies, power relations, charity, empathy, psychological relationships with globalized phenomena catalyzed by the Internet, the hyper-sexual consumer-driven ego-centric society of the then and now, the dynamics of urban space, gentrification, the artistic act of inserting work into the public domain.</p>

<p>Tyler rewrote my bio for me after I sent him the one above:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Casey was born in LA. After failing as a child star the family packed up and moved to the New York suburbs in hopes that his younger sister Niki could make it on Broadway. After finding himself one night in the East Village, Casey discovered that there is actually more to nothing than most think. Since then Casey has spent most of his time in the void creating PDFs and preaching the gospel of Github. Casey is adept at using the computer and has a lot of thoughts about the internet and administrative bloat. When he isn't impersonating Lana Del Rey, Casey is most likely found creating the world he wants to live in at the beach. Going from bloat to boat, Casey splits his time between a condo in Boca and a Williamsburg flat. Casey has no children.</p>

<p>Commodify that, bitches.</p>

<p>Tuesday was my last first day of school. Biked there! Tried with Kristi and Jon to put up Hope's banner again, since all the building's Free Cooper flair came down over break, but it snapped three separate times. Waiting for more cooperative weather and people who are better at rigging banners.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/9afda8274bc7c20d0349173988d0bd64/tumblr_inline_mhcxoerzGN1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Art history was cancelled. Ran around a little bit trying to organize for a protest outside a board committee meeting at one. That meeting turned out to not exist. I wrote about the goose chase on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaveCooperUnion">Save Cooper group</a>:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; ### <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SaveCooperUnion/permalink/415405331868466/">The Case of the Phantom Meeting</a></p>

<p>&#38;gt; <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d971b3588823cfd3ed935c6740af5667/tumblr_inline_mhctji2M2h1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#38;gt; In a Nov. 14 email Jamshed Bharucha wrote, "[A] special meeting of the Board of Trustees will be scheduled for late January to decide on our course of action." On Calcium (events.cooper.edu), the Board Room had been reserved for an "Executive Committee Meeting" today from 12 - 5pm.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Just before noon, students gathered to go stand outside the meeting, while two students planned to go inside to take public minutes and livestream.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Only…there was no meeting. The lights in the Board Room were out and the door was closed.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; A student elsewhere in the building said that she heard an older man and woman talking about the meeting, and that they would "Skype in from within the building".</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Four students went up to Jamshed Bharucha's office and handed a petition for student representation at Board meetings with 434 signatures to Lawrence Cacciatore.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I went up to the office and asked Geoffrey Olsen about the meeting. I'd think he would know, being the one who confirms Student Council's Board Chair meetings. Geoffrey said there is no meeting today.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Lawrence popped out of Jamshed's office to shut the door, and ask me if I could come back later because he is "in the middle of three things". I asked Geoffrey about the March Board Meeting being rescheduled, as Kelly from CUAA had reported below to this group, and he said it has not been rescheduled.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I made an appointment with Geoffrey to meet with Lawrence tomorrow at 11am. I hope to clear up this misunderstanding, get correct meeting dates, get an updated list of who is on what committee, and check-in on the bylaw archive that he refused to let me help with, promising that it would be online by the end of December.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I bumped into David William, who coordinates events in the School of Art, and asked him who reserves rooms on Calcium? He directed me to Brenda Ferebee, the college's Coordinator of Records and Room Reservations, who I tried calling. She didn't pick up.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Going into the computer lab across the street, I noticed that all the blinds in Jamshed's office were down, while him and Lawrence (and maybe others?) were in there.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; It's our first day back at Cooper and students are ready to go(!). But we're already contending with disappearing meetings and straight answers from nobody.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Who reserved a room for a meeting that isn't happening? Is this meeting happening now? Did it already happen? Is it happening in the next 8 days, as "late January" comes to a close?</p>

<p>One of our librarians got back to me in the comments and said that the bylaws/archive/git-like administrative workflows project I had been pursuing had actually rolled along a little bit and there were PDFs online now. So I scraped those haphazardly versioned PDFs into Markdown, threw them into <a href="http://github.com/caseyg/bylaws">a Github repo</a>, and wrote a little screed.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/c28c6fe9e88f02f7630481959d30bba7/tumblr_inline_mhavg8l6KL1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#38;gt; (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</p>

<p>&#38;gt; A lot of people have approached me up in arms about shutting up unless I've got a financial solution. I'm of the opinion that financial solutions with any integrity at all will only happen in conjunction with other types of more important changes: systemic, rhetorical, technical.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; So here is something nerdy:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; This repository contains an archive of <a href="http://cooper.edu">Cooper Union</a>'s Bylaws from 1996 - 2012. Having done nothing more than pull these documents together into a folder, they already highlight the sloppy and outmoded manner in which Cooper's administrators create, distribute, and archive information.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Going forward I hope to use these documents as raw-material for experiments outlining best practices for living documents and content management systems that are transparent and accountable.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; If this collection doesn't look particularly interesting that's because it actually isn't! But getting access to this ostensibly public document's history has been an arduous, bottlenecked procedure (it shouldn't have to be)...and the collection isn't even complete. Where, for example, are the original 1972 Bylaws which all these revisions amend? Where is the history of every document? If we weren't keeping it already why aren't we starting this second?</p>

<p>&#38;gt; After a month of heckling the Secretary to the Board of Trustees, a mixed-bag of documents was passed to the college's Library, whose staff quickly posted them online. The files varied substantially in formatting and accessibility and were therefore hard to compare. I set about standardizing the documents as much as possible so the ways that this governing text has changed over time can begin to surface.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; The first step of this is that most of the PDFs have been converted by hand into <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, a plain-text writing format that provides for a little bit of structure. If you're adventurous, you can already download the files in the <a href="https://github.com/caseyg/bylaws/tree/master/markdown">/markdown</a> directory and plug them into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff tool</a> like <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com">Kaleidoscope</a>.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; In my dream-world I use this space to build tools that shoehorn these principles directly into the administrative workflows responsible for creating and distributing this mess, so that ridiculous retroactive unpacking efforts such as this are not necessary.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; But this is a start.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; The original documents were accessed from <a href="http://library.cooper.edu/archive/bylaws/cu_archives_docs_bylaws.html">the library website</a> on January 23rd, 2013. The six PDF files available on via the library are archived in the <a href="https://github.com/caseyg/bylaws/tree/master/pdf">/pdf</a> directory of this repository. One version of the bylaws, made available by the library in HTML, is not yet archived here.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; ┬──┬ ﻿ノ( ゜-゜ノ)</p>

<p>On Wednesday I realized I had missed a karaoke birthday party the night before because I was, um, busy reformatting governance documents.</p>

<p>Met with Lawrence, Secretary to the Board of Trustees, and I showed him my Bylaws Repo and explained how this accountability could be built into the way things run around here and not have to be some bottlenecked late night rogue archival project. He wrote down the word "<a href="http://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/">stigmergy</a>", which is the title of the best post in a series of writing on <a href="http://georgiebc.wordpress.com/category/collaboration/">Systems of Mass Collaboration</a> by Heather Marsh that I read over the break. That felt like some abstract kind of progress, although ultimately he told me my expectations for how I want Cooper's administration to function are too high. Really. He said this. And then went on to confirm the extent to which a kind of purposeless toxic incompetent secrecy and disorganization plague Cooper's management. For example, he confirmed that it is not public information — <em>not for us to know!</em> — when the board meets, where they meet, what they talk about, and who is on what committee. I get that um, some corporations and institutions are private, but, like, we are being governed completely in secret by a board to whom we have no recourse and who doesn't have to tell us what they do or who does what. Oh yeah, and my expectation — that they disclose these simple facts and archiving their documents in a way where they don't just disappear — is too much to ask. Got it.</p>

<p>The real shame is that the board members are the owners but not the stakeholders here. Sure, they are generously volunteering their time to lead this institution and each donating some money, but when it shuts down or turns to shit because the trustees <em>can't be expected</em> to listen to their constituents or run their proceedings in a legible manner, it's the students, faculty, staff, and alumni who really lose out. Trustees maybe have their reputation dinged for a little bit or something.</p>

<p>In other governance-ish news, I discovered a majorly stupid security flaw in the multi-million dollar unified database thingy that our shopping-addict Vice President decided to go ahead and buy, so that I or anybody could pretty easily log into most accounts. Which I didn't. I met with somebody who is going to try to fix it. This system cost millions of dollars and it sucks. There are six "password complexity rules" that end up making me forget my password and having to spend ten minutes figuring out a new one every time I want to log in. There is no justice!</p>

<p>Realized, when I was signing up for sculpture, that my Wednesday class is really small and we are all friends already, so I got a class list and we all got margs beforehand. Niki did her insane sculpture rant and everyone giggled.</p>

<p>Put on <a href="http://archive.org/details/AdamCurtis-TheCenturyOfTheSelf">Century of the Self</a> in an empty room and watched it in a marathon showing with Alex and and a few other people who walked by. But fell asleep before getting to the end of the last part.</p>

<p>On Thursday I attempted to clear everyone's lock-in shit out of my studio, which proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/838f19c7ae51e562d74b85730271fd31/tumblr_inline_mhctryKJCg1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wrote a <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/41389280244/do-you-ever-feel-like-youre-being-watched-ha-ha-me">little post</a> about weird spam emails I've been getting.</p>

<p>Had a "drawing" class with Seth, who is a visiting artist, and it was fun because he isn't one of the old-timers who just goes on a tirade. Went around introducing ourselves and it felt butterfly-y like a real first day.</p>

<p>I was handed-off a folder with a few missing pieces for my bylaw archive by the library.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/78465b27f84de532efac2e2292bdb1d1/tumblr_inline_mh5uqf3bns1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The envelope had been <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/383376102/the-girl-gingerly-picked-up-the-two-lighters-and">used and reused</a> so at points it had held things from the Vice President and CONFIDENTIAL things from a financial lady and now on the last line it had my name including the fake <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von">aristocratic preposition</a> which indicates we-met-on-Facebook.</p>

<p>Anyway, Documents on paper. I felt weirdly like I had...nothing to <em>do</em> with them.</p>

<p>Sherry Turkle <a href="https://readmill.com/CaseyG/reads/alone-together-why-we-expect-more-from-technology-and-less-from-each-other">gingerly laments</a> how hitting [send] is the most important part of having feelings today. "Technology does not cause but encourages a sensibility in which the validation of a feeling becomes part of establishing it, even part of the feeling itself...things move from 'I have a feeling, I want to make a call' to 'I want to have a feeling, I need to make a call,' or in her case, send a text. What is not being cultivated here is the ability to be alone and reflect on one’s emotions in private." I don't know if she's right. I mean, I don't want to think she's right. I mean I want to think <em>well I</em> read her book therefore <em>I</em> can have an emotion without <em>posting</em> about it <em>see</em>!</p>

<p>But then I was opening and closing the INTER-DEPARTMENT DELIVERY folder's little red string clasp like an idiot because I never intended to read the words end-to-end, and I didn't actually <em>reeeead</em> the versions, and I don't intend to proper. I copied and pasted and refactored and saved and committed and SHAREd a feeling I had about what the words mean and do. It's so stupid and simple that you have to print something out to get me to read it. BECAUSE "<a href="https://readmill.com/CaseyG/reads/uncreative-writing-managing-language-in-the-digital-age/highlights/emwo-q">Digital language foregrounds its material aspect in ways that were hidden before...its malleability, language as putty, language to wrap your hands around, to caress, mold, strangle.</a>" And being passed ink-and-paper in the middle of a text-as-in-bits basketball game is like being thrown a brick.</p>

<p>It's something I thought about the other day when I read what <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/allen-tan/2013-january-23/">Allen wrote</a>:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Printed publications can be categorized by how they bracket time — dailys, weeklies, monthlies, quarterlies, annuals — and are as much tied to their pace of production as to their worldview of what is the most interesting span of time?</p>

<p>&#38;gt; We haven’t yet formed good answers to this online. Streams reflect our ability to instantly put things out there, but what is the right amount of time to talk about an idea? To deep-dive into a subject? To have an argument? To celebrate, or to mourn?</p>

<p>One answer: every possible timespan. Online publications and content are, at their core, databases. In a way that printed things are not. Query your content 10 different ways! Show me a stream! Show me a graph! Show me &#38;gt; 1 year ago next to today and shuffle it every five seconds! Show me them all at the same time each on their own screen!</p>

<p>I know there's physical hypertext and accordion books and scrolls on paper, but paper is mostly codexes to be r &#38;rarr; e &#38;rarr; a &#38;rarr; d. <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/drafts/">"Everything on the internet is instantly contemporary."</a></p>

<p>Lots of thoughts that don't make that perfect sense but are banging around:</p>

<ul>
<li>"the validation of a <a href="http://reading.am">Reading</a> becomes part of establishing it"</li>
<li>"wrap your hands around digital language, to caress, mold, strangle"</li>
<li>"Print is tied to pace of production and worldview of what is the most interesting span of time"</li>
<li>"query your content 10 different ways"</li>
<li>When the tree that made the paper for the booklet fell I think it made a sound. But a tree falls offscreen in a videogame, for efficiency reasons, it usually won't be rendered for reasons of efficiency so it actually never makes a sound.</li>
</ul>

<p>Friday morning has sculpture with Dennis. Forgot how good <em>he</em> is at the first day rant thing. So good. Went out and bought Montaigne's <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/41451568507/when-i-rail-at-my-manservant-i-do-so-sincerely?og=1">Complete Essays</a> after he talked about it for a while.</p>

<p>Had Biology with Oliver, he runs Genspace, the really cool community genetics lab in Brooklyn that Kevin took us to when I had him. The class is exactly high school, but it's okay because everything else I'm taking is similar in a way where you just sit around and rant and show and tell. So taking a high school-ish bio class feels kind of exotic and important or something. I have a feeling I'm going to be sad about not dropping it though, with homework, and quizzes, and presentations and stuff.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/150988cbd76a1455c3a75ba21a2206b6/tumblr_inline_mhcu0gglGz1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aaron started a weekly freeform 15-minute Slideshow Club at school which is a really fun idea. Couldn't decide between presenting something about <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/systems/read/#genetics">genetics</a> or <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/29008891777/a-five-page-summary-of-nine-five-page-business-book">business books</a> or <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/26877511013/bloodletting-medicine-lcds-computing">screens</a> or <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/40725501755/skeuomorphs">skeuomorphs</a> or something new or a thingy I'd been writing about Cooper. So I printed them all out. Then got REALLY cold feet and was feeling generally terrible about everything I've ever done and not done and am going to do. Then went out for drinks beforehand, but like WAY TOO MANY drinks. Like I only vaguely remember Slideshow Club happening and apparently spoke for 40 minutes drinks. Like everything linked to above and the drafty thing about Cooper below drinks.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/80b06cb24e1c814252ce7a9dd164abc4/tumblr_inline_mher9dinnL1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#38;gt; Look at this list of trades that Cooper whisked students out of in 1859! Amongst the pupils were: a Coachmaker, two Melodeon makers, a Burnisher, four Penmakers, a Telegraph Operator, a Gilder, and eighteen Stone Cutters.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Last year the quarry in Connecticut that provided the Brownstone for the Foundation Building closed because it had been mined until there was nothing left. Did Cooper offer scholarships to those out of work Stone Cutters?</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Global capitalism has complicated what it means to be working class in America.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Do any of the other vocations admitted in 1859 still exist today in New York City as working class jobs? Makers of Melodeons? Coaches? Telegraphs? Pens?</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Do they exist as jobs at all? Maybe amongst trust-funded Brooklyn artisans capitalizing on the almost charming obsolescence of an identifiable human making factory-lined and outsourced things.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; The two pens on my desk, a Sanford and a Paper Mate, are made in Korea and Mexico, respectively. But I’m not writing, I’m typing on a computer etched with the somewhat awkward phrase, “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” The subtext being that it was assembled in China by an army of anonymous workers employed by a company who’d probably rather not be named, but is actually Foxconn, a subsidiary of Hon Hai Precision Industry, the #10 largest employer in the world (BBC).</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Some of the other largest employers in the world today are #1 US Department of Defense, #2 People’s Liberation Army of China, #3 Walmart, and #4 McDonald’s.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Education has continued to grow into a global industry replete with teeth and tentacles. It would appear from this roster that New York City's working classes in 1859 didn't go to school, they went to work. I suspect that only a small minority of admitted students at Cooper today were independent, working class laborers before coming here. Today's incoming classes arrive in orderly masses from the extended adolescence of high school.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; In a recent essay Clay Shirky identified a change in higher education from being a mechanism of class mobility into a hostage situation where you either go to college or actually risk falling down the class ladder. And of course, many people’s parents work at Walmart or make lots of money but live just as outside their means as anyone else, so they can’t afford tuition.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Reading this document left me with some questions about how things have changed: When did Cooper switch from admitting the working class to admitting high schoolers on merit, irrespective of class? How has the “working class” changed in the past century-and-a-half? What’s the point of higher education today? Why does college cost so much? Despite these questions, I don’t really want to quibble about history. Cooper obviously isn’t what it was founded to be. (It’s hard to imagine how it could be…maybe by recruiting students from Walmart and Foxconn.)</p>

<p>&#38;gt; But with a fair amount of patching, this place stands (precariously) as something unique in the landscape of higher education. We need to think about how to carry forward the idea of using an educational institution to do something about class immobility.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Rewriting history. An hour became 50 minutes. Tuition was never part of this mission.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; It doesn't matter. It's what it means today. We're strong.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; James C. Scott "while the planner cannot create a functioning community, a functioning community can, within limits, improve its own condition"</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Jane Jacobs community</p>

<p>&#38;gt; * * *</p>

<p>&#38;gt; That idea is timeless.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; 150 years after this institution was founded, those entrusted with its mission need to ask big questions all over again</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Peter Cooper declared that this place should, "instruct, elevate, and improve the working classes of New York City without charge”. But Cooper isn’t really about educating workers anymore. It’s not a women’s school. It’s not a night school. They knew this would happen, which is why they wrote: “Of course, defects in the plan and its execution will from time to time appear, for which the remedy will be promptly applied…all suggestions for its improvement will receive a respectful consideration.”</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Here’s a suggestions: those for a Free Cooper Union should return not the the historical instantiations, but to the timeless idea behind this place: using an educational institution to do something about class immobility.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Today we’re dealing with a whole different beast.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; “[The Trustees] earnestly request that all persons who take an interest in popular education, will visit the institution; and from such, all suggestions for its improvement will receive respectful consideration.”</p>

<p>&#38;gt; If everyone is equalized by being a high schooler heading, the hope is, to college: let us not forget that families are of different socioeconomic backgrounds, are sometimes not there or not supportive, and high school educations range in quality from boring to okay. I've heard insane stories from classmates and professors about life situations—dead-ends or worse—which Cooper whisked them out of. But I applied to Cooper straight out of high school from a wealthy suburb of the city, having only “worked” an unpaid internship. I knew nothing about</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Later, I found out that my great-grandpa had taken classes in the engineering night school. Whoa.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; But</p>

<p>&#38;gt; We live in an entirely different world where this institution has, for whatever reason, emerged as a stronghold of free education. This institution has changed. from its stated intent, sometimes to “remedy defects in its plan and execution”, but recently for worse reasons.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; We made it h</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Bharucha told a journalist that he wants to strengthen "our commitment to access for students who most need it"</p>

<p>&#38;gt; It even seems like some of the compelling Cooper Stories I've heard draw indirectly on the past</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I don't care about Peter Cooper's commitment to access in 2013. I'm grateful beyond words for this institution and happy to have Peter Cooper as an icon, but actually, looking back, not every single one of his ideas is still brilliant and relevant.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; The Alumni Association has been soliciting stories of where people would be “Without Cooper.” My story feels kind of conflicting.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; What it means to be working class has changed.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Before college students even <em>get</em> to be any kind of class they go from High School to College.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; ,, and higher education has become a lucrative bullet-proof industry.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I’d be curious to see a socioeconomic breakdown of Cooper’s current student body today.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; The planet has changed materially, culturally, socioeconomically.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; We don’t live in the same world and we don’t go to the same school.</p>

<p>&#38;gt;</p>

<p>&#38;gt; What do the “working classes of this city” which Cooper was founded to “” look like today?</p>

<p>&#38;gt;</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Does Cooper still recruit working class?</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Did these</p>

<p>&#38;gt;</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I’m grateful to the Library for archiving and posting this amazing documents, but I'm tired of quibbling about history. Look what a different world it was!</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Thanks to our librarians—Julie, Carol, and everyone—for archiving the document.</p>

<p>As you can see, that last part isn't finished at all and there isn't really a point yet. So I'm not sure how I got through it. In fact, I think I just like knelt over mid-sentence at some point in that and died. Somewhere in there my glasses broke too.</p>

<p>Later somebody told me, "your presentation had a lot of topics." I was like, thanks.</p>

<p>Somehow made it to a party and there was dancing.</p>

<p>On Saturday went to Jackson Heights with Aaron and Tyler for infinite Indian food yay. Then MoMA. Where if you have a laptop in your backpack you have to carry it around with you. We basically saw it all and nothing did anything did anything for me oh well. In some galleries we were like WTF HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE WE'RE TRAPPED because I guess they curate shit all snake-like and infinite-loopy these days.</p>

<p>Got contacts to replace my glasses, which are probably better suited to my spastic, flailing ways.</p>

<p>Then got ice cream with Aaron and we were next to Katie Holmes and Suri lol.</p>

<p>More dancing.</p>

<p>On Sunday we regrouped as Bread &#38;amp; Cheese aka the Cooper Lock-In to talk about our Student Judiciary hearing coming up on Friday. We will see how that plays out.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/6c558094eb194f8949fffead25dd7528/tumblr_inline_mhcu9ctpXv1qz4rgp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then tagged along to Brad's new reading group <a href="http://bhqfu.org/chat">Chatroom</a> with Aaron. Speed-read <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/hi-haters/">Hi Haters!</a> by Rob Horning on the way there. Good reading. Good conversation.</p>

<p>Headed straight to a Spokescouncil meeting, which is the Occupy-ish structure full of mediation and painstaking horizontality that was set up for student action on the ground in December. But everyone was tired of talking about talking and lost regarding the fact that there aren't super clear dates or goals right now and everyone hates meetings so it was hard. Seemed like people could get behind of stigmergy!!!!, a.k.a. just do things and people will help you. Although that doesn't work for a lot of people who still want to be involved in a capacity that doesn't involve starting projects all the time and leading them. A non-annoying structure that's less cumbersome might not hurt but we haven't found it yet. Really it's all flailing all the time and always will be, I suspect. Doesn't get easy. Makes you tired. But it's important. Things to work on: common ground, creative actions, new shape for spokes council, meeting less often, stigmergy and sudo leadership, bylaws project, dance parties, idea oriented meetings, board meeting actions.</p>

<p>Had a work-related stress dream that's actually hilarious where I was hired to design a children's library but it had to have corporate slogans and brand names all over the chairs and stuff and I couldn't tell if I should do the project or turn it down. One of the chairs had to have the word STOCKINGS on it, as some kind of sponsorship placeholder. Even my dreams want to go off the grid maaaan omg.</p>

<p>On Monday had Dore's class. Didn't bike because it was snowing(!). We basically just talked about whatever and she told us that's how the class will run and she picked a random word as the title "Synartesis" and nobody has ever asked her what it means and it doesn't matter anyway, and then read aloud to us / told us to read Nietzsche, Valery, Don Quixote, and Coleridge. I got annoyed when a few people started rambling about their ideas of objectivity, an endless discussion. But Dore was pretty insistent that we not worry about pinning things down and instead float two inches off the ground like that, speculating.</p>

<p>In relation to the idea of pinning down, remembered the Barr Chart, which I once almost wrote something about kind of.</p>

<p>And thought about the <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/inventingabstraction/?page=connections">Inventing Abstraction</a> show we'd run through at the MoMA, where years later they're still trying to pin down art history. This time, zeitgeist-ily enough, in a graph.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/83cf369fe02ab3bddd926c8ec7146caf/tumblr_inline_mhcudkhOCD1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Did a lot of weeknote compiling. Forgot that damn it takes a long time.</p>

<p>Met a client about a project.</p>

<p>Went to mooooore meetings for Student Council and Board Meeting action prep, which were all well and fine. I want to go to less meetings though.</p>

<p>Stayed up late at home discussing who would walk out of school alive if there was a post-apocalyptic hand-to-hand combat battle for survival against each other. Probably all the extra security they've hired going to our heads.</p>

<p>Tuesday, today, wrote my weeknote again in the morning. Biked to school in the fog, which made for a beautiful bridge crossing.</p>

<p>Had Walid's projects class. We listened to everyone's projects. I recapped my last semester presentations which were: passing out a booklet of my <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/user-generated-content/">User-Generated Content essay</a>, giving a slideshow on Ted Nelson, doing some of the same readings I drunkenly re-did last week, making weird long boring videos of myself reading lists of words, reading, writing about, and tinkering with the bureaucratic/organizational structures and workflows at Cooper, and then getting sucked into the lock-in and politics here a lot. Then I sort of ranted and raved about how all I want to do, I think, or can figure out how to do, is to rant and rave about systems and technology around me and controlling the world. I want to babble more. Speak and write. Walid said I did that last semester. LOL. I talked about how differently I feel when I'm thinking about art (CYNICAL ALERT! MUST DESTROY.) versus political action (optimistic and inclusive). How I think it'll actually be easier once I graduate because I'd probably operate well and get some material from inside some organization or corporation or just real life, but art forms usually feel futile to me. He asked why I'm not taking a leave to do that. Um, well, I don't actually want to get sucked into some bureaucracy. I guess I love the necessary amateur-ness of artists thinking about things they're not experts in is really exciting to me. But I'm kind of floating without a particular goal right now. What am I showing next week? Um, I don't know. We argued as a class about artists writing about their work. I think I'll make a wiki as my proposal.</p>

<p>I'm also slated to show for Dennis's class on Friday. Hm. Hrmph. AAHAHhhhh!!!</p>

            <p>I've been reading <em>Literary Machines</em> slowly, whenever I find a blank spot of time. On Saturday I sat outside with coffee and Sneezeburg and re-read Vannevar Bush's <em>As We May Think</em>, which Nelson transcludes in a lo-fi way into his own book. I took an Instagram of a passage about progress in photography to give everyone who ever wrote about progress in photography a spin in their grave.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cohuEBvj1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Nelson and Bush seem to get pretty hung up on technical (or even mechanical) hurdles rather than conceptual ones. There's a lot of fussing about, in Bush's case, how to shuffle microfilm around quickly, or in Nelson's case, complicated server configurations. It reminds me of how characters in sci-fi movies park their hovercars to go use a payphone. These inventors are willing to imagine radically different worlds but can't let go of the most banal limitations. And the things they lamented not having are no longer pipe dreams! Reading their texts in 2012, there appears to be no reason why a Memex or Xanadu can't exist, other than that they just don't.</p>

<p>It seems like Nelson specficially, who I guess is still working, is too smart for his own good. Too wrapped up in the details of his obsessions. "It seemed so simple and clear to me then. It still does," he writes, "But...I mistook a clear view for a short distance." If <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html">perfectionism can be said to plague Nelson's projects</a>, it must also be acknowledged that it's his philosophy of choice. I was shocked to read his justification for why Xanadu must be built from scratch, completely and perfectly: "Existing systems do not combine well; hooking them together creates something like the New York subway system."</p>

<p>The New York Subway system?!</p>

<p>In my System Design class, we lauded this as one of the most functional examples of emergent design ever. New York could've suffered from some clunky, overdetermined, shortsighted, top-down transportation plan. Instead, a number of transportation companies competed to get the people where they needed to go. Competition between companies and the <em>lack</em> of an overall design vision led to a shift in emphasis: not what makes sense, but what works well. Perhaps the problems that bogged Nelson down indefinitely only reveal themselves in time, but I wonder if somebody with more distance or a less stubborn idea of the right way to build things could actually <em>build the thing</em> — even if it isn't perfect.</p>

<p>I also never realized that Bush thought a lot more about interfaces than Nelson, who basically rejected them entirely (at least as far as I've read):</p>

<p>&#38;gt; How you will look at this world when it is spreadeagled on your screen is your own business: you control it by your choice of screen hardware, by your choice of viewing program, by what you do as you watch, but the <em>structure</em> of the world—the system of interconnections of its stored materials—is the same from screen to screen, no matter how a given screen may show it.</p>

<p>I think a lot about the ability to have my choice of interfaces to the same materials, which is something users and readers are too often denied these days, as the interface and materials have become intertwined under the ownership of the publisher.</p>

<p>Things like RSS feeds, <a href="http://guardian.gyford.com/">news APIs</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cooperhewitt/collection">open content sets</a> give me hope. There's also the whole pop-up industry of Read Later tools, whose dirty work it is to boil down webpages to their content and repurpose it for easy reading. It has proven proven easier, in lieu of a perfect system, to ask for forgiveness rather than cooperation in separating content from presentation and bringing it into your own territory.</p>

<p>iPad magazine apps reside at the other end of the spectrum. While they're an additional, native interface that is sometimes exciting, they present a sort of glum vision: impenetrable, redundant, expensive, flashy, proprietary.</p>

<p>Nelson's decoupling of backend and frontend is pretty profound. It underscores the base-ness of his ideas: he's talking about <em>different structures</em> for writing and thinking, not just presenting plain old content in a style that evokes structure. There is not necessarily a <em>visual</em> difference between these two things but conceptually it is huge.</p>

<p>Even if the real problems lie in data structures, I can't help but gravitate towards the descriptive aspects and imagine tools I'd want to use. I love Nelson's vision of computers as "a waterworks for the mind":</p>

<p>&#38;gt;Your computer screen will be the spigot—or shower nozzle—that dispenses what you need when you turn the handle. But that system must be based on the fluidity of thought—not just its crystallized and static form, which, like water's, is hard and cold and goes nowhere.</p>

<p>Two days later, Max started a Google Doc amongst a bunch of people who are normally bantering on Twitter about reading, writing, and tools for thinking. His title is so good: "Let us not be an enemy to beginning." I don't know where to jump in yet, but found myself doing little interface experiments.</p>

<p>These are little prototypes of picking things up and moving them around. When they're being dragged they lift up, or the perspective shifts a little. I wasn't even sure what it's for, only that I enjoy fiddling with how it should feel to pick up <em>information</em> from one spot and plunk it down in another.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpd5EnzC1qzrmn8.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpd9NpTP1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I played a little with a force-directed graph but didn't get very far into understanding how it works.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpdgMmcD1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Two days later I was noodling again. I did some drawings in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8">Paper</a> (that slick new iPad sketch app that has everybody going bonkers over its super gestural interface).</p>

<p>In the first frame two things start to bleed into eachother as they're brought close together.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpfajg091qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When one thing is dropped onto another, the tool shows a dialogue with its best guess about how to combine the two things into one. You can edit it and then either merge or cancel.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpffzcfo1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you want to seperate things out rather than merge them together, you can pull sentences apart at their punctuation. (Which would feel springy…imagine doing that with a pinch.)</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpfj1A7K1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpfr08mS1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The previous things were all coded prototypes. I managed to implement dragging and dropping (which, these days, just means including "draggable" in the element tag) and collision detection (using a plugin that I realized was written by a professor at Cooper). When I started to think about how to program the blocks to be combinable and splittable I got overwhelmed and chickened out. I did arrive at a sort of working page that watches a textbox as you type and splits up sentences into draggable elements. Okay, well, it only kind of worked.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpfw5UY81qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>All of these experiments felt a little silly because the dragging and dropping and merging is perhaps slower and clunkier than just using a text editor to write. In the past few years I've gone back and forth manically on believing that better tools will make much of a difference. Can you get more powerful and open-ended that a blank sheet of paper or TextEdit window?</p>

<p>But I've recently come to see the "tools make work better or worse" as a false dichotomy: different tools just make working <em>different</em>, in a way that hopefully exists outside of quantification. Increasing power or efficiency is a lot less interesting to me than inventing a game you play with yourself to change the way you think.</p>

<p>You can do everything in the sketches above with a text-editor: collecting, typing, dragging and dropping to reorder, merging and splitting sentences. But a different interface would encourage a different mindset. Different relationships. Different ways of describing what you're doing, like maybe: growing a text instead of writing it. They key actions being: <em>arranging</em> things on a 2D canvas for consideration, and <em>combining</em> related things.</p>

<p>It's almost an architectural conceit: altering the way you can move through a certain space, and trusting that one's environment has a huge impact on everything you do. It's not a question of allowing you to do something magical that didn't exist before, so much as knocking down a few walls and building a swimming pool, to make one's environment feel more conducive to thinking.</p>

<p>Who knows if it would be helpful or frustrating, or if I would ever actually use it, but it's a way of working that has sat in the back of my mind for a long time and has even surfaced in analog form. When I wrote <a href="http://pooool.info/user-generated-content/">a long essay for Pool</a> last summer, I actually cut the whole thing up (with scissors!!) and pasted it back together at the last minute.</p>

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3eqg6EK9W1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This would be a digital environment that allows for that type of scatterbrained writingediting.</p>

<p>I came across these GIFs by <a href="http://dvdp.tumblr.com/">DVDP</a> that capture a really exciting kind of physics. I'd be interested to see how I work in the atmosphere of a game, as opposed to something like Google Docs, reminiscent of a utilitarian cubicle farm with floppy disks and manilla folders.</p>

<p>Apple gets this right a lot of the time, think: coverflow, <a href="http://watchingapple.com/2009/11/a-closer-look-at-iphone-transition-animations/">iPhone physics</a>. When I saw the sander on a sheet of paper, it reminded me of how the tools I use <em>should</em> feel: badass! I don't care how, it just has to be.</p>

<p>That's all I've got on that, for now. Now, back to our regularly scheduled chronology.</p>

<p>Sunday I changed my avatar, which is silly but always feels like a big deal. I've stepped out of the shadows to reveal longer hair and different glasses. Less smiley, more <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jteuton/status/191560379485274113">judgey</a>. Felt like I was living a lie.</p>

<p>Walked Sneezeburg over the bridge.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cqbjdXTv1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hung out on the stoop at school and read.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cqjzEbhq1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Got Pizza with Aaron and let Sneezeburg have his way with the box.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cqlwgcVT1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walked over the bridge again, home. It's electrifying.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3coivoSmv1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On Monday a <a href="http://www.20x200.com/artworks/4116-eadweard-muybridge-animal-locomotion-plate-626-galloping">Muybridge popped up on 20x200</a>, and I remembered that I had an old gift certificate lying around, so I used it up on that.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3eyj5Vxsd1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And pulled my Rebecca Solnit book off the shelf to look through again. God she's good:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;In the spring of 1872 a man photographed a horse. With the motion studies that resulted it was as though he were returning bodies themselves to those who craved them—not bodies as they might daily be experienced, bodies as senstations of gravity, fatigue, strength, pleasure, but bodies become weightless images, bodies dissected and reconstructed by light and machine and fantasy.</p>

<p>&#38;gt;...</p>

<p>&#38;gt;Through the new technologies—the train to the landscape, the camera to the spectacle—the Victorians were trying to find their way back, but where they had lost the old and familiar things they recovered exotic new ones. What they had lost was solid; what they had gained was made out of air. That exotic new world of images speeding by would become the true home of those who spent their Saturdays watching images beamed across the darkness of the movie theater, then their evening watching images beamed through the atmosphere and brought home into a box like a camera obscura or a crystal ball, then their waking hours surfing the internet wired like the old telegraph system. Muybridge was a doorway, a pivot between that old world and ours, and to follow his is to follow the choices that got us here.</p>

<p>Gratutious Sneezeburg pic (Sneezeburg x Metahaven!):</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cojcGo6g1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="Sneezeburg" /></p>

<p>Then I registered for classes, which will be superawesome: Performance, Projects (for which you just have to have some sort of long-term project going on—I listed mine as "Hypertext"…hmm.), Open Studio (that is sort of a sculpture class?), Visiting Designers, and History of Industrial Design. Open ended, lots of great professors.</p>

<p>Alan's <a href="http://cooperrelocation.info/php/letter.php">Fake Cooper Website</a> made in onto <a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/shocker_cash-strapped_cooper_union.php">Gothamist</a>. Really good.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning I had coffee and breakfast with Mom in Brooklyn, and said goodbye to Sneezeburg :'-(</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cqy9fhdV1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went to school and people were picketing!</p>

<p>Don't remember what happened in photo, but we didn't stay long. Don't know what I want to do. There is a scientific photography class in the School of Engineering that I should probably have been in instead. They are making holographs. HOLOGRAPHS!</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3coldjKLs1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Remembered that I was supposed to give a presentation to my Censorship class about my paper, which was overdue two-weeks and I hadn't even started. Had a fun time putting it together: videos of Bjork, burning cars, nerdy quotes:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpe8ke281qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wednesday, met up with Jen's friend Sally, who is visiting from Sweden, for coffee. She studied art history and is going into the curating program that Jen is about to graduate from, so it was interesting to talk with her. We talked for a long time and then I showed her around school.</p>

<p>Futzed with ideas for my final book for Publication Design. Brought in hardly any design, but printouts of Temple Grandin and Ted Nelson and other things vaguely along the lines of "people who make systems or tools for themselves." Or structures of problem solving? Business strategies? I was calling it Workflow. None of the pieces fit together right, though it was potentially interesting. The challenge is to do the content and design in a matter of a few weeks with a ton of other shit swirling around too. Not easy. Need to be less open ended. Perhaps picking a stupid idea and running with it. Ugh.</p>

<p>Stayed up really late tinkering with the code for my new website, which has come a long way since I started it over spring break.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3ct4fgJ7T1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It's now running on Stacey and has a ton of sloppy, kooky javascript that draws connections between projects when you hover over tags and click on them. It's not the most functional way to accomplish sorting, which might not even be an important use case for a portfolio site, but it's another weird way to channel my mania for lines and nodes. Between this and the interface experiments, I've been thinking a lot about the aesthetics of this kind of mapping. Something to think more about. Excited to launch this soon.</p>

<p>Thursday, skipped art history. Felt weirdly blue. Maybe it was because I missed Sneezeburg. Apparently he was missing me too:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3frkspzP81qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walked over the bridge, and stumbled into the Storefront for Art &#38;amp; Architecture, where they had a forest of <a href="http://www.storefrontnews.org/programming/exhibitions?c=&#38;amp;p=&#38;amp;e=475">zine trees</a>. The director, who is in that picture, was there gviing a tour, which was neat. Kind of useful to browse a bunch of avant garde publications. There is no shortage of people with things to say and ways to say them:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpiraFhR1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I got to school there was a fire drill. I went outside and randomly bumped into Cari, who I haven't seen since high school, on the street! And she is moving to Ohio in a week! Then, a few minutes later, Max walked into my classroom. The smallest world.</p>

<p>Don't remember sculpture. Had a weird dinner at Grand Sichuan composed of 80% spicy peppers. Tasted like acid and had the consistency of cardboard. Watched the first two parts of <a href="http://archive.org/details/AdamCurtis-AllWatchedOverByMachinesOfLovingGrace">All Watched Over By Machines Of Loving Grace</a>. Pretty crazy. Really excited to finish it and learn more about his work. Made me think about people with grand unified theories. Specious!</p>

<p>Friday, met Santi in the East Village and headed up to our Megabus to Baltimore. The bus left an hour late. On the last bus ride I had gotten a lot of work done, but this time it was dark and cold, and a strange hour, conducive neither to neither work nor sleep. When we arrived it was past midnight. And we were in a parking lot 30 minutes outside the city. In choosing Megabus over Bolt due to timing, we hadn't bothered to check where the drop off was. Luckily there were two of us to split the $50 cab ride (grrrr). Always great to see Natalie and Zoe. Hung out for a bit while Santi made endless quesadillas and then went to bed.</p>

<p>Saturday we had breakfast with Natalie's mom and sis, and then tagged along while she got ready to put on her show. Santi did makeup and I sat around pretending to work on my essay.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3comrxSzT1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://cargocollective.com/natalieebaugh/T-U-D-E-K-R-E-W">Natalie's collection</a> is reallly good. So happy to have made it to the show.</p>

<p>Santi made desperate attempts at cancelling Megabus by phone to no avail, then I tweeted at them and they called back with a refund in minutes. The internet is magic.</p>

<p>Got Afghani food with Santi, Lauren, and Frankie, and went back to Natalie's where we watched Illuminati videos.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we got standby tickets on a random Bolt Bus, which took us back to NY, except by way of NJ. But I had nowhere to be anyway, and there was this short news segment about cats who make art on iPads playing on the PATH TV screens, so it was okay.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3conbDLkQ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="Cat iPad art" /></p>

<p>I tried to buy toilet paper and ice cream (ha) on the way home and my card wasn't working. Tried it again at an ATM and still didn't work. Tried again later and when it still didn't work I called Chase, who informed me that there was a fruad alert on my account. Had I spent $100 at the Apple Store? Yes. (Lost my charger.) Had I spent another $100 at a Kmart in Virginia? Nooooooo. The card was still in my posession so it was just the number that migrated, I tried to think but couldn't imagine when/where/how. Anyway, keep it classy, fraudsters!</p>

<p>On Monday I walked to the bank to get a replacement card. "You'll be amazed at the places your card will go." she told me.</p>

<p>Don't remember what else happened that day.</p>

<p>At the grocery store the pettiest thief in the world attempted to steal gum.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cooxdcYf1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I made a little user stylesheet to show images from <a href="http://browncardigan.com">brown cardigan</a> to show a full screen random funny thing every 6 seconds on our wall!!! That was rewarding.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3coptjZhX1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started making a presentation for photography. Well, only one slide of some sad ass sensitive photos:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3ft6cLuHx1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I've been thinking about how I've done so much nothing — or a lot of thinking and railing against things that people make (sort of shitty of me in a school context) — but the attitude of the nothingness has changed over time. Maybe I should stop calling it nothing. Anyway, I used to be a lot more mad at photography and now I am weirdly more empathetic and apathetic at the same time. I find a lot of it boring but no longer wish to destroy it, like I actually did a year ago. I want to compile all the things I've seen that excite me, but I don't even have them in organized groupings of bookmarks. Photo as a technology is a much stronger draw for me than roadtrip photography.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/cooper-union-will-charge-tuition-for-graduate-students.html?_r=1&#38;amp;smid=tw-nytimes&#38;amp;seid=auto">broke the news</a> that Cooper will charge tuition to undergrads. WHAT? I was furious.</p>

<p>It was Alex's birthday and I wanted to be happy but I couldn't even laugh at jokes.</p>

<p>I received a school-wide email from President Bharucha at 12:14pm. The New York Times ran their story at 12:22pm. It clearly wasn't written in that 8 minute gap. Which means the administration once again talked to the papers about their plan before even telling the students. Fuckers.</p>

<p>There was already a walkout scheduled for Wednesday, so I made a sign in light of the day's news:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3ftjwtT0C1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Put up maybe 40 around the school, then gave a bunch to some friends and then I went to my Censorship class. When I got out there were signs plastering every surface of the path towards the auditorium where a TEDx event was being hosted (Ran into Emily there!). Ha.</p>

<p>Aaron took this photo of me:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cq4tefe31qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went to The Scratcher for Alex's birthday.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning I was offered my iced coffee in a mason jar instead of a plastic cup. In case you were unsure as to whether or not I live in Brooklyn.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3corfQW0W1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>By the time I got to school the Cooper Walkout was in full swing!!!!</p>

<p>In the morning tried skyping with Jen but wifi was flaky:
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpuhL9G71qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>People marched in circles with great big signs. Jesse Kreuzer got up on the Peter Cooper statue and danced.</p>

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cospomfq1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Read a few lines in a play that some people put together about how stupid the trustees are, and then we circled the school, chased by a giant head of the Chairman of the Board.</p>

<p>Went up to Union Square where we watched this choir perform. That was funny. And saw some speeches.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-_3gb8A6Dis?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>This lady's sign was my favorite. It has shredded student loans as confetti.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cotlXrB91qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>David Graeber spoke. I want to read his book to understand more about the whole situation, because it's kind of wild watching people burn their debts. Everything is fucked up.</p>

<p>Followed the march back to school, where everyone stopped for a minute to hear about Cooper. And left the cops swarming our block as they tried to get Jesse down.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cot4ocOG1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sarah Abruña was arrested for what appears to be basically no reason.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cotzGRsi1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here I am hanging off the building in somebody's photo.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cowy5l0M1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="Me hanging off a building in somebody's tagged photo" /></p>

<p>I was quoted in <a href="http://www.galleristny.com/2012/04/students-pr0425201/">Gallerist NY</a> and <a href="http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2012/04/26/cooper-union-students-protest-tuition-announcement/">New School Free Press</a>. But <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2012/apr/25/grad-students-will-soon-foot-bill-cooper-union/">WYNC got the story best</a>, I think.</p>

<p>Didn't work on design. And then met with Warren for a scheduled one-on-one, after I had been screaming my head off for ten hours. Decided to do weeknotes book. Partially because I am running out of time, but also seeing how many bad artist statements I came across recently reference an interest in cabinets of curisoity I want to take more time to connect or tease out all those weird things instead of just throwing them into a book stew. It's not actually about that. Warren is smart. His class has been, totally unexpectedly, the best one of my semester.</p>

<p>Thursday our Art History class met at the American Museum of Natural History for a field trip. We talked about the racist statue out front, and how the horse has gigantic balls. Then we explicated the gender/cultural norms in a bunch of dioramas. A really creative, fun fieldtrip. Though it made me think there's potential to kickstart a Post-Gender Museum of Natural History. Lolol.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3coujVfBN1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The museum becomes a diorama of museums too. Certain galleries that were last refurbished in the 70's would need nothing more than a sheet of glass placed over their entrances to become compelling meta-exhibits.</p>

<p>Read an article by Felix Salmon: "<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/25/why-cooper-union-cant-be-trusted/">Why Cooper Union can't be trusted</a>." From the title it seems disheartening but is actually in support of the community, and our efforts to clean up the school's act.</p>

<p>Skipped sculpture to go to the Cooper Community Summit, which was really good.</p>

<p>Friday, it was decided that the plan is to walk out every day. So I brought my laptop outside and spent all day writing.</p>

<p>Lunch was served and people discussed a proposal to give away all the works in the end of the year show with Saskia.</p>

<p>Kept writing all day and into the night. Finally published this in desperation, an hour before the place we were going for dinner was closing: <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/public/two-apologies-president-bharucha-must-make/">Two Apologies President Bharucha Must Make</a>.</p>

<p>Ate Thai food! Then watched every movie trailer from A - Z. The kind of fun that feels like being tortured. I made it to L before falling asleep, but Aaron and Alex made it through.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3covwbGRG1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Saturday, Bruce High Quality put on a play called Animal Farm in the Great Hall. I don't remember anything else.</p>

<p>Sunday, met Niki at Grand Central. Had lunch at Ippudo with Dad and Niki. Made a silly gift for Granny and Grandpa's 50th(!) anniversary and sent it to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://5880.me">Max started blogging again</a>!</p>

<p>Stalked Pentametron for a while. <a href="http://gawker.com/5905550/weird-internets-the-amazing-found+on+twitter-sonnets-of-pentametron">This Gawker article is good</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3cpjq4zfb1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Worked on the freelance project for a while and got a lot done.</p>

<p>After sending that off sat down (er, kept on sitting) to put the finishing touches on the new <a href="http://pooool.info">Pool</a>.</p>

<p>I had sent Louis a kind-of rude message in December saying: "The collection of writing/readings/people is good and Rasmus's pdfs are clever but I'm always confused by how crappy/default the actual site design is." So it's exciting to have finally channeled my random frustration into a new site: even more austere, more readable, simplest permalinks ever, potential for bigger images, got rid of the previously confusing concept of issues/archives while highlighting Rasmus's awesome PDFs,</p>

<p>Monday, walked to Greenpoint with Alex. Got sandwiches. Worked at Grumpy but didn't get very much done at all.</p>

<p>Finally moved my domain off GoDaddy.</p>

<p>Skipped what sounded like a good lecture by James Gleick, whose book <em>Chaos</em> I've read and <em>The Information</em> I've been meaning to read forever. Heard there were good meetings about the state of the school, which is increasingly dire.</p>

<p>Turned in 5 pages by midnight, then took a 5-Hour energy for no real reason. Managed to take naps and eventually fall asleep after staying up too late and not getting work done.</p>

<p>Tuesday was Mayday. Critted a bunch of peoples' work in photo, which was good, conversationally, but not great. As good as it will get. Walked up to Union Square after with Tyler but we couldn't even get into the center. It was slow and loud and there seemed to be one cop for every two protestors. Walked back towards school with the march and peeled off to go to the openings. Blacked out in the hammock in Aaron's studio and woke up at midnight. The train took an hour to get from Manhattan to Brooklyn, so I read almost all of <a href="http://friendsofcooperunion.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CooperUnion_TheWayForward.pdf">The Way Forward</a>. It's really good.</p>

<p>Today I worked on this weeknote at home and then school, amid distractions like this <a href="www.vice.com/en_uk/read/im-sick-of-pretending-i-dont-get-art">Vice article</a> that reminded me I don't actually hate art. At least not as much as I hate Vice.</p>

<p>I am constantly wanting to refer to that meme: Pop Music: forcing you to defend something terrible because it's being criticized so poorly. I should just make it myself, since I can never find it.</p>

<p>When I wait too long to put this together it ends up taking up a whole day, or even days. Jesus christ. This one started out so strong and has really petered out by this ending.</p>

<p>Asked the library for sheet music for the Alma Mater song so I can make a dubstep remix, but they claimed not to have it. Will have to bug the office people in external affairs.</p>

<p>Louis bought me dinner as a thanks for Pool and we hung out, which was nice.</p>

<p>I won't have a sculpture by my final class tonight. So what's left to do at a minimum is: censorship essay, publication weeknotes book, publication diaries, photo presentation, freelance project, Jen's thesis website, art history midterm (heh), final, and horrible theory annotations. There are six days remaining. It will be necessary to go a little crazy.</p>

            <p>On Thursday I showed SweatyTube again, this time to my sculpture class, kind of with Aaron (except he didn't say a word). It was a totally different vibe than the first time around in Christine's photo class. Mostly, I think, because Bea had brought more than enough wine, pop rocks, and rock candy for the entire class — leftovers from her show — and I went last. So the lights went down, a bootyshake video went on…on a sweater, and people laughed. Instead of babbling I kept my mouth shut and people threw out suggestions for the next video. Again we talked about the limits of memes: you get it or don't and laugh for a sec and then it's over. How they're the sort of thing that doesn't go very far and you don't return to. Keep thinking about a thing Tyler said in photo that I might've twisted, but: part of why they're funny is because the joke refuses to end. But people also looked closer than in my photo class: Maddy brought up how compositional everything looks, which I think is a big part of it too: generated but compositional. Niki wanted to know if I am swimming with a rubber ducky floatie in a sea of nihlism. Or what the internet means to me. I didn't answer right then except to mumble that it definitely isn't just a sea of nihlism for me.</p>

<p>Just salty water.</p>

<p>Friday morning we grabbed just out of the oven Calzone things from Napoli bakery on Metropolitan Ave., which were unreal. And then we headed over to catch the Boltbus to Baltimore. We were bored <a href="http://storify.com/caseyg/trolling-boltbus">so we all trolled Boltbus</a> on Twitter. I am happy they chose not to respond. I have still never been on a plane where I have wifi, but can you imagine how passive agressive you could be?? The sky is the limit, as they say.</p>

<p>Also got a ton of sort-of-overdue work done on The Freelance Project and sent off a slowly uploading comp just as we hit B-more. It's very helpful to be trapped in a seat with slow internet for a few hours.</p>

<p>This was my second time coming to Baltimore. But even when I've passed by on Amtrak towards Granny and Grandpa's in Virginia there's the same horrible emptiness. So much built up unoccupied space. Disorienting, coming from New York. You can see how Baltimore was glamorous in a past life.</p>

<p>Natalie met us at the bridge where Boltbus drops off. YAY. Running hug. And then we walked to meet some of her friends and get sandwiches. Then off to a mall, which I guess is pretty Baltimore, but also pretty much everywhere-except-New-York-City. So that was nice. I also had about $10 in my bank account, not enough to widthdraw cash and scarily low to use a card, but was owed a back amount of utilities and split dinners and whatever, so I was hitting up the bank of Aaron and Alex all weekend. Half funny and half a hassle for all involved. Alex bought me those weird awesome mall pretzel bites. Went to two openings that were kind of whatever but interesting to check out the scene.</p>

<p>Saturday morning we snuck into MICA's dining hall for breakfast, which felt awesome because I'm so horrible at playing it cool. Ate weird gross dining hall food and <a href="http://www.snopes.com/college/admin/laxative.asp">debated whether they put laxatives in it</a>. Hitched a ride to Value Village, where Bank of Alex bought me a ridiculous shirt and cap. Aaron got a nice shirt for his opening. Alex got his typical horrible things. Walked around MICA for a bit and then headed downtown where we ended up at…another mall. The South Street Seaport of Baltimore, basically. Got burgers and fries at Five Guys and sat by the water.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2eg6lIvWD1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then hobbled to the other side of the water and onto a hill. Then walked down into a different area of Baltimore that felt kind of like a college town or something. Feel asleep on the bus on the way back to Natalie's. She took a picture and bedazzled it on some amazing iPhone app that is like Pika Pika.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2eheoiWSA1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aaron's opening at <a href="http://www.nudashank.com/exhibitions.html">Nudashank</a> was cool. His work looked good:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2eh2e0Yxc1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And I liked these videos by <a href="http://alanresnick.info/">Alan Resnick</a>:</p>

<p>This girl sitting outside was, like, blogging IRL in a Moleskine about the show. Don't <em>think</em> it was a piece.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2eh59vpza1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went back to Natalie's and watched Mariah Carey's cribs episode. Which is just really worth a few minutes of your life.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xcs9tUiMlmQ?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Then went to a party that turned out to be some freaky, fratty no-pants thing. So instead we sat outside. I would be fucking terrible at being a college student, if that's what it's supposed to be like. Ran into Suzy from back in RISD days.</p>

<p>Sunday Morning grabbed a bite to eat and got on the bus to New York. Walked up to dad's, showered for the first time in a few days, which was awesome. Took a cab in the rain down to Nom Wah Tea Parlor. Dad and Niki were mad at me for dragging them out in the rain but then we all had fun. Niki started crying when I brought up college. Forgot how much high school sucks and how stressful that whole situation was.</p>

<p>Survived April Fools Day with no pranks. Didn't even really notice any online ones.</p>

<p>Don't really remember Monday, except that I did a bunch of <a href="http://reading.am/CaseyG">Reading</a> online.</p>

<p>Tuesday pretty much everyone showed up a few hours early to Photo to look at and talk about work, which was okay.</p>

<p>Then we headed down the the <a href="http://mtprawvwdorlna1.nyc.gov/luna/servlet/RECORDSPHOTOUNITARC~19~19">Municipal Archives</a>. The building itself is worth a visit, just to see the marble lobby. I feel like they used to design building interiors darker. I can't think of dark modern architecture…it's almost like architects don't consider darkness an option today.</p>

<p>Michael Lorenzini, the photo curator there, gave us an overview of what kinds of things they have in their (gigantic) collection. They get each mayor's things after they leave office, so there are a lot of photographs touting improvements around the city. His speciality is this one photographer, Eugene de Salignac, who single-handedly documented a lot of city maintenance and construction — bridges in particular — but had a much sharper eye than straight record keeping calls for. They're publishing <a href="http://www.aperture.org/books/browse-by-photographer/s-z/new-york-rises.html">a book of his work with Aperture</a> that looks really good.</p>

<p>Other highlights of the collection are two huge sweeps of New York intending to capture every single tax lot. Effectively Google Street View before there was such a thing. A massive undertaking with bulky old cameras. Apparently they are gearing up to do it again? Seems kind of unnecessary when those images basically exist. Made me excited for when street view will not only allow you to navigate space but also time. It's potentially already possible with the documents in the Municipal Archive, it would just need to be hooked up!</p>

<p>Another amazing part of their collection is the NYPD's archive of crime scene photographs. Tons of fascinating gruesome shit:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2ehz1m8kC1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The crime scene photos are an interesting resource because in the margins of their primary subject (dead bodies!) are a glimpse at the interiors of crime scenes: New York's shady, rundown underground. Places too poor to be recorded for their own posterity.</p>

<p>Then we went down into the conservation lab, a clean but dingy basement in this impossibly lavish old building. We met a lady trying, with a scalpel, to finagle open a document stuck to itself. Michael and some colleagues showed us old negatives in various states of decay. They handled things a bit less gingerly than I experienced on our trip to the NYPL archives and also seemed a little less stuffy in general. A really fun group of archivists to hang out with.</p>

<p>Skipped Censorship for real this time, since it was cancelled last week and I still hadn't written my draft. Went to openings and then worked in the computer lab until late on Infinite Scroll.</p>

<p>Woke up on Wednesday, got to school at a reasonable hour and hustled on design. Bought a bunch of speckled paper from the copy shop. Got a velour paper and a metallic cardstock from NY Central. Worked until class just on putting together more pages.</p>

<p>Pretending they had no idea what the magazine was already about (even after weeks of group crit) Warren asked the class to say what they each magazine is about and why. Which turned out to be more helpful than I thought it would, because it made clear which parts of the design telegraph certain aspects of what it's about. It also kind of helped pin down what the content comes across as being, which was pretty much what I wanted: an academic design journal crashing into internet art and culture.</p>

<p>It's far from done, even as far as the class assignment goes, let alone the whole magazine (not required but now I'm kind of into it). Not to mention the content is basically being ripped from people I have followed and bookmarked without any sort of consent, some headlines refer to things that don't even exist, and editorially things could stand to be clarified. Not sure what some of the things I wrote down on the cover actually are, or if these things benefit from being hypothetically packaged together. Also, showing progress with iPhone snaps is kind of pathetic because a big part of it was dealing with the physicality of a magazine: so speckled papers, acetate overlays, waxed pages, velour, and metallics don't come across well.</p>

<p>Talked with Ioana after class about how much work it is to accomplish so little with publications. Especially working solo. But I like it. Then went straight home, exhausted but excited. Did nothing but couldn't fall asleep until really late.</p>

<p>So, Thursday I overslept Weinstein. Mom showed up to drop of Sneezeburg before her and Niki headed to Florida to look at colleges and beaches. But first found outdoor seating in Brooklyn and had Mexican food with mom and pup. Walked Sneeze over the bridge and to school. Tried walking in with him and was stopped by a guard. Tried to sneak him in inside a bag but the guards were on to me so I just sat outside. Missed Niki's class but chatted with her outside after class was over about ways to sneak him in. She's really good at that.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2dtua9RCZ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Friday stayed home and worked next to the world's laziest dog, which made me feel productive. I've wanted a new, more comprehensive website for a while, since mine is really out of date at this point and just feels wrong. So I built a new Stacey template, did major data entry to get updated project information into it, and worked on the styling. Also figured out a way to manage revisions of writing and projects, which is super exciting. Want to add back in some of the crazy tag filtering and connector line things I was working on over the break, take a final pass at content, then this is ready to go.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2erkzFi8E1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The other nice part about having a dog around is that it forces me to take walks. Walked by this weird futuristic medical storefront that seems like it's from Eternal Sunshine or Being John Malkovich.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2dtscTSEd1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Worked on The Freelance Project late into the night, extending the mockups made on the way to Baltimore to a few more pages and then jumping right into a coded prototype covering most of the site.</p>

<p>Saturday, walked Sneezeburg up to Greenpoint. Got coffee and a bagel. He got really tired because the walk was so long, and I think I've been keeping him a lot more active than he is in the suburbs, so I had to carry him home the last couple blocks!</p>

<p>Finally sent essay proposals to Joanne. They're a mess but it's a huge relief to have sent something…anything out. Already thinking of revisions, additions, clarifications, where before there was just procrastination. Some 3500 words on social network parasites, sinister computer vision, tools for forgetting, github, skeuomorphism, curator's code and xanadu, and frictionlessness.</p>

<p>Really good call about The Freelance Project. Soon it will be an actual website and I can talk about it by its name. Excited for the project in general, as it's a cool idea, so I'm happy to have a hand in launching it. Going to try some more exciting or avant-garde design ideas, since I kept these versions pretty Dribbble-y. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>

<p>Had interesting Twitter banter about Ted Nelson with @AlexisMadrigal, @Litherland, @ftrain, and @tealtan. It basically led to writing down the Bobst call number for Literary Machines and watching this video in horror.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AXlyMrv8_dQ?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Went to a fun party hosted by some architects with Alex. Danced all crazy and jumped on their couch, etc. and so on until late.</p>

<p>Sunday, napped all day with Sneeze. Read a good thing <a href="http://sangamithra.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/on-amateurs-and-access/">clarifying the history</a> of paid education at Cooper Union:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;It appears that the original [paid] amateur classes were less about creating access for the poor than they were about allowing access for the wealthy, who were not held to the same rigorous standards as the students who attended for free.</p>

<p>Pretty much debunks one of the ways that President Bharucha has weaponized the school's history against its own ideals!</p>

<p>Finally read <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/">Bruce Sterling on The New Aesthetic</a>. Really good. Though nothing could prepare me for the borderline annoying onslaught of New Aesthetic stuff in the coming week.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2dtq9hlMN1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jessia lent me The Poetics of Space and The Arcades Project came from Amazon. Overwhelmed by big dense books. Tried to read Poetics of Space twice and got through three pages each time before drifting back into a nap.</p>

<p>Watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dod34d_tDeI&#38;amp;list=PL2399D7EB6E015984&#38;amp;feature=plcp&#38;amp;context=C46de1ddFDvjVQa1PpcFMv61u8KxD9Aw81M-fc_W5jEDWGiyir-M8=">Why Are You Weird</a> with Alex on the projector he got. (Yay!) It's funny if you have a love/hate relationship with art school.</p>

<p>Monday, walked across the bridge with Sneeze and Alex. Got Literary Machines from Bobst! One of three copies in NYC, which I have until June. Sat outside all day and read slowly and distractedly. (Though the book is supposedly non-linear.)</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2et57xISF1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2et5jAXkV1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Played with Sneeze and he made a lot of friends. Didn't have a phone or computer all day, and then returned home to find out about Instagram's billion dollar acquisition wwhhaatt. Went and got Crispy Duck! with Aaron.</p>

<p>Tuesday, worked on coding the front-end for Pool. Louis figured out a design he likes that's super austere, so I started implementing it and it actually looks awesome on iPhones and iPads. My first time doing a site "mobile-first" and I'm really happy with how easy that approach makes certain design decisions. The complexities of a layout can grow out of its simplest possible instantiation, rather than being compacted if working the opposite way.</p>

<p>Tried writing my essay on the projector at home. Sort of as a joke. Didn't get anything done.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2dtv0EWwo1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went to photo. We always start to have interesting discussions about photography as a medium and all the problems. Christine always wants to talk about archives. But people don't seem to really be pursuing those ideas in their work agressively enough to excite me. Most of the stuff we look at is just boring, the biggest problem being: would I even stop to look at this? Maybe that's stupid. Half the class is also extremely quiet, so the dynamic feels off between me, a few other loud people, and the mum half. In talking about work it's usually a very nod and smile kind of conversation, which really makes me antsy.</p>

<p>Walked to Economy Candy with Aaron and bought sour straws and chocolate instead of writing my essay. Censorship was boringinteresting. We watched Godzilla's American and Japanese versions. I made this amazing sling out of my sweater and slept through most of that. Exhaustion, boredom, sugar crash.</p>

<p>Had a wild conversation on Twitter with a bunch of people about Pinboard, Findings, Reading and Readmill. Love the brains of that bunch. Allen <a href="http://storify.com/tealtan/pinboard-technique">Storified it nicely</a>. And Henrik from Readmill wants to meet up in June and talk, which is exciting.</p>

<p>Max uses DMs like IMs, which I've never done with anyone else. But we had a really exciting conversation about futures. Felt less scared about my (lack of) summer plans after talking to him.</p>

<p>Spent Wednesday bouncing between trying to write the Censorship essay, procrastinating, and reading about desconstruction for Pub Design. Deconstruction sort of makes me eyes glaze over, even though it's exciting in a boringinteresting way.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2dtvrMxsE1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Had a really <a href="http://storify.com/caseyg/criticism">good exchange with @litherland about criticism</a>. She pointed me to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/puttingourhotheadstogether/">this article by Cary Wood</a> that I wish was written less specifically about web design because it so applies to everything. Was thinking both about my frustrations with the quiet class that would rather nod and smile than stir up trouble. But also about how social networks enforce a kind of positive "Like" and "+1" but also just the idea of networking, which makes it hard to be critical towards sensitive people. Anyway, that article zapped a frantic feeling I didn't know I was having. Grateful for that.</p>

<p>Publication design was good. I am so, so surprised that I am finding it to be my favorite class this semester. I have never really liked a design class, but Warren is tough, smart, and funny. Had a good discussion about DeconstructionNnNN. Then talked about our ideas for the final project. I'm giving mine the tentative title of "Workflow." In a broader scope than the magazine, which inevstigates software design, this is about machines and systems people invent to adapt to the world. Some examples: Ted Nelson inventing hypertext for his hummingbird mind, Temple Grandin calming herself down with a cow squeezer. Those are famous examples, but everyone has their own things that they do. Still need to work on understanding what these interests are about and how they fit together.</p>

<p>Finished my candy. Tried to stay up late and write my essay but…fell asleep.</p>

<p>Today worked on my Censorship essay while in Western Theories. Otherwise zoned out or worked on giving myself water poisoning to escape to the bathroom and not have to deal with such a dangerously boring conversation. I like Weinstein, which is the weird part, but can't stomach the class at all. I think the one time he called one me I was like: I hate all these theorists. All of them. Not going to talk about Rosalind Krauss. And he kind of moved on. I feel bad that I don't feel bad about being so inattentive, but my attention span was wickedly short today and it feels dangerous to know this stuff too well. It trips my bullshit detector. I'd learn it at a different time in a different place, but can't do it now. Hoping I can pass it, at this point. Ate noodles with Aaron then ran back to Brooklyn to walk Sneezeburg. Worked on this weeknote and then zipped back to school for sculpture. Sculpture was good but, again, no focus today. Was basically on my phone for one entire crit and then climbing up the walls for the next. I feel like an asshole, as Aaron pointed out, I was being one. I would hate having myself in class a lot of the time. That criticism discussion also reminds me of ways that I want to be a better classmate.</p>

            <p>Tuesday night we went to Ippudo for dinner, which was awesome, and then Aaron took over my Facebook for an hour when we got home. I watched in horror and amazement:</p>

<p>Wednesday was weird. After writing the previous weeknote I spent all day <em>not doing</em> my design homework, which was to make a magazine. It's not like I don't think about this all the time. Maybe I think about it too much. Instead of working on it, though, I was having pretty interesting Twitter banter with @dvsch about <a href="http://t.co/1xtcwCCl">Khoi's latest post on digital magazines</a> and reading <a href="http://www.robinsloan.com/fish/">Robin Sloan's latest</a>: a "tap essay" which is, of course, smart. I don't know why I get so procrastinate-y about design homework but I think I was annoyed at having to think about and work with print (which is like SooOOoO obsolete—jk, maybe), and apathetic about having to come up with a themed interest and do things a certain way. Design assignments and I do not get along. Went to Baoguette with Alex and got a sandwich with Thai chilis so spicy I almost blacked out, then showed up to Warren's class at 6pm with <em>nothing</em> for the second week in a row. And the worst part was that I felt...serial killer calm. Pretty sure the appropriate response in a situation like that is to be freaking out. Felt like I shouldn't talk because I talk too much anyway and I brought nothing to the table so I was a little quiet, but got a lot out of seeing other people's progress.</p>

<p>Thursday is hard to remember. Had a decent art history class in the morning. Then just kind of looked at the internet for a long time:</p>

<p>Browsing aside, I think my biggest accomplishment was responding in center-aligned emoji poetry to an email from Youngna about how well things are going with Girl Walk and passing along some thanks for the website.</p>

<p>Had the first really good sculpture class in a while, interesting discussions and lots of work to talk about from people. Got a milkshake, bought groceries, and went home.</p>

<p>Friday: did laundry, then walked over the bridge with Alex, then <em>finally</em> turned in a proposal for my Censorship term paper. I'm actually pretty excited about it because I can just babble about computers:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; I propose writing my final paper on bias in computer systems, or the (many) problems with how computers affect access to information. This is a logical continuation of my first essay, which unpacked money’s role as a form of information and the potential for it to therefore become “censored.” Computer bias, which still on the fringes of traditional censorship studies, has amassed a good amount of academic sources, and there are, of course, many familiar and historical points of entry: from the subtly biased interface design of the Sabre electronic airline ticketing system popularized in the 80’s which caused profits within an industry to shift overnight, to the currently unknown long-term effects of today’s sudden proliferation of recommendation algorithms for all aspects of life: from dating to movie watching. The paper hinges on quiet forms of censorship which can be hard to detect and are sometimes unintentional,. After preliminary research, I have come to the conclusion that the two best way to grapple with this problem are educating designers to be aware of computer bias, and educating users to approach computers more critically. While honing in on specific examples such as the Sabre system, Netflix, and OkCupid, I hope to touch broadly on interface design, algorithms, history, and education.</p>

<p>Saturday was back in Rye for a quick doctor's appointment and grabbing all my clothes which I forgot at home after break. I noticed a tweet from one of my childhood BFFs about Metro-North when I was on the train, and then we realized we were on the same train!! But we somehow missed each other at Grand Central.</p>

<p>Saw this mushy Occupy tag on Metro-North. Bleh!</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1ne8fnEDK1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went to school and climbed on the building because the weather was nice. Everett took this from afar, lolol:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1ntsxNkCh1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Kengoe and Bryson came over and we all hung out and screamed Bieber late into the night.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1necxB4EN1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Was introduced to Katy Perry's new video, which is offensive/horrifying(/possibly brilliant?):</p>

<p>I can't tell if the military thing is just like a really stupid metaphor but it seems really zeitgeisty. What war is that?? Normandy?? Just creepy and insulting to women (she joined the Marines because of a breakup??), but I would totally put this in a history book. Did the military pay for this shit??</p>

<p>Sunday went out with Alex to get new shoes, since my boots no longer had laces at all and the weather is getting all summery! Ended up walking around for hours, going into every shoe store and a bunch of fancy stores. Stopped for a really good lobster role, because soho was getting to my head, and then got a sort of ridiculous pair of white shoes at David Z. that look like something a Euro person would wear to a nightclub or golf club in 2004. Whutevs.</p>

<p>Read the internet a lot again:</p>

<p>So much of my work recently has involved writing things on screen, and it's made me feel exhausted, distracted, and strained, so Monday morning I bought a pack of loose-leaf and some pens, and laid out five different projects on my desk.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nefoSvJ11qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Despite setting up a structure that I thought would be conducive to ADD, jumping between tabs, in a way, I ended up focusing on design and got almost totally caught up on my responses to our class readings so far. Also got a lot done in terms of figuring out what I want to make a magazine about.</p>

<p>Kept writing for a while:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nemazAH31qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then took a nap, and was awoken from a nap with a rant streaming in over DMs about Curator's Code—which was awesome. Somebody reads this shit? And they want me to expand on something? Done. More on this soon.</p>

<p>Back to work: what was freaking me out was that I thought we had to make a whole magazine, when in reality we only have to do a few spreads to demonstrate the execution as a kind of portfolio piece. Part of me has a hard time designing something if I have to fake it and the only content is Lipsum text, but another part of me also has a hard time finishing things. When I reframed the assignment as a project I was allowed to start and not finish I suddenly had terrific momentum. Reading all our class readings about "designers as authors" and how desktop publishing and the internet are changing design, I started trying to articulate what a magazine could still provide in a world where the tools to do everything as individuals and the networks to effortlessly distribute things to people are at our fingertips. So the form should deal with this meta-concern about publishing. In terms of content: one of the strongest threads throughout the things I read and think about is the design of what goes on screens. Left to my own devices (pun) I'll sit around all day fiddling with new things and breaking them. My roommates make fun of me for being a paid spokesperson in disguise, like in the Truman Show:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BhIIPbO_6xg" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Part of the reason I like Wilson Miner's talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/34017777">Why We Build</a> is because it finally armed me with a defense against that joke. He asks: "What is your time-to-screen in the morning? 5 seconds? 30 seconds? We're not just making pretty interfaces, we're in the process of building an environment where we'll spend most of our time for the rest of our lives. What do we want that environment to feel like? What do we want to feel like?" Designing for the screen, and poking around on it all day, can sometimes feel like just pushing pixels or being part of Facebook's evil plan, but I believe this actually <em>is</em> the world we inhabit. Maybe that's a fucked up thing to think, but everyone I ask about their time-to-screen has said five seconds or less.</p>

<p>So: a journal of screen architectures. Boom. I started culling and collating the best things I had read online recently about designing screens and imagined inviting the authors to expand beyond blogposts. Now this became something I REALLY WANT TO DO. Here are a bunch of leads pulled from my Pinboard to flesh out the first issue: <a href="http://blog.findings.com/post/19346681104/how-we-will-read-kevin-kelly">Kevin Kelly wants to pay you to read his next book</a>, <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/110081/Buzzing-about-network-graphs">Why haven't we seen a picture of the whole <strike>earth</strike> internet yet?</a>, <a href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">Stephen Wolfram's over-examined life</a>, <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/5579">Robin Sloan on constellational thinking</a> (these are some of the best ideas I know of out there, but the posts actually leave something to be desired...here is where expansion and editing could come in), <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/deploy/">Mandy Brown on Deploying content</a>, <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/11/the_social_graph_is_neither/">The Social Graph is Neither by Maciej Ceglowski</a>, <a href="http://language.cont3xt.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/vierkant-imageobject.pdf">the image object post-internet by artie vierkant</a>, <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3622698.html">my mother was a computer by n. katherine hayles</a>, <a href="http://basecase.org/env/Facebook">charlie lloyd's angry reverie on software</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, I started thinking about weird formats and strategies for making print content out of screens. What would it be like to publish a week of BERG London's mailing lists, from which they generate their amazing <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/tag/links/">link posts</a>? I want to see people go through and annotate their recent linkroll (I've been enjoying <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:robertogreco">@rogre</a>'s, mostly for the insane tagging), what about some kind of <a href="http://dismagazine.com/discussion/29786/club-kids-the-social-life-of-artists-on-facebook/">collaborative/track changes authorship</a> (though I'm depressed by the outcome of that instantiation...)? How could trolling be an editorial strategy? As I've enjoyed the <a href="http://twitter.com/ftrain/statuses/179565012795404289">light</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Mike_FTW/status/180144424767078400">trolling</a> of Curator's Code, recently.</p>

<p>Got sushi and went to bed, but didn't fall asleep until late.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning ran into Joanne on the subway, which was like a sign from the universe (and her) that I should wrap up those essay ideas and send them her way.</p>

<p>Then had photo. Christine started class by saying she felt super weird about last week's crit. After some probing from a few people in class she kinda turned to me and was like, "your work really threw me off. We should talk." So <em>that</em> was nerve-wracking, but also felt kind of exciting. She told me that she knew taste shouldn't be a part of it but she really didn't like my work. I told her that I was kind of pulling a cop-out by showing SweatyTube, which was never supposed to be a "piece," though I still feel it's closer to my interests in photography than wandering the streets with a black and white camera in search of moments or whatever. We talked through a lot of stuff for half an hour, outside in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Christine felt too like it might've been a mismatch of audience for an inside joke, which I agreed with. She said she felt like I have to guide the viewer a little more, and that I wasn't really in it at all. Which I disagreed with. I told her about the funny comparison between a hyper-fabricated minimalist cube and a website that people can't grasp the process or authorship of. Impenetrable! I had achieved Larry Bell-dom, and all I felt was confused. Again, a weird conversation because SweatyTube really might not have that much to it.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nww1VPuW1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was kind of scary and exciting when Christine mentioned not being in the work because I've been dealing <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/2010/not-in-my-work/">literally</a> with that phrase for a long time.</p>

<p>When I started giving myself a harder time, getting in the way of my work, or lacking narrative/heartstrings/touch was when shit started getting REALLY interesting for me. Work before I started questioning work was a totally different kind of naive. Since then it's been a majorly recurring and strengthening theme for me. Christine was like, you know why writers drink so much right? Because it feels horrible to sit alone in a room and put yourself out there. (This completes the trifecta of all three of my studio teachers being like, you should drink! see also: "if you're stuck on a design, print it out, have a drink and take another look" and "you don't need an excuse to drink in sculpture class!" Oh, art school.)</p>

<p>After having sooooo many conversations about this with every class and teacher I've had in the past few years I totally see how the work I make (when I manage to <em>make</em> it) and questions I ask come across as cynical, removed prototypical defensive mechanisms. The work gets mixed in with the defense mechanisms for me, but I can't help hovering in this meta-space. I hope it's not purely some immaturity that I get over when I'm 30, like Christine and others have suggested. I'll be pissed if there isn't something here. Professors who claim to love failure and then wonder if I'm getting in the way of myself? Hello, I fail HARD. But maybe slow and quietly. It's not something to intervene in, it's something to push.</p>

<p>I still get all confused.</p>

<p>But I could say with more confidence this time that the problem is the content. The systems and structures and platforms and archetypes are what I'm interested in prodding at. Even Kevin and I butted heads about this, when he insisted that the way to sell people a system was by telling a story about it. It's just not how I think. And while Christine is apparently "flatlining"(!) when she sees the lack of <em>something</em> in my work, I sort of flatline when I see horrible ideas executed brilliantly. A straightforward series of big beautiful portraits just isn't that interesting to me in terms of problems I hope to push at, even if the human gaze is the most complex thing in the world, or whatever.</p>

<p>I felt unresolved and pried open in a good way. It feels like we leveled out in a helpful way to each other, and perhaps the most interesting thing I took away was the possibility of working in every direction at once. If sensitive photographs or boring portraits make me want to gouge my eye out, maybe instead of running away from or attacking them, I should actually be tearing in their direction, too. To get a better understanding, firsthand.</p>

<p>I kind of felt like these pugs:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9uuqXXT7VYo" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>And then I was thinking about negotiating these long running threads in my work as knocking antlers with myself. A slow fight.</p>

<iframe width="500" height="254" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wsyed4Weu0M" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>This too:</p>

<p>I skipped Censorship, because I hadn't gotten around to extending that proposal into a draft and we were going to be workshopping. Miraculously it was cancelled! Hanna Exel showed up to openings, was great to see her and her family for a few moments. Hung out for a long time in the studio with Tyler and xD.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning I grabbed a stack of looseleaf, sat down with a coffee, and drafted an editorial statement for Infinite Scroll, which is what I'm thinking of calling that magazine. Still very in the works. And it's not much of a strategy to republish other people's blog posts, so there's a lot of work ahead:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="c1"><span>Each new medium becomes a container for all the media that have come before it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Google Books realizes the dream of a total library. Total access. Yet who has actually read a book on it? It&#38;#39;s for search and research. Not going to pull a Franzen and say these things acn&#38;#39;t be done on screen, which would be like saying you can&#38;#39;t look at a picture of a book on a screen. Of course you can. But the reasons are different. So, what does a print magazine about screen architectures afford?</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>There is something frighteningly seductive about the screen! People reported having &#38;quot;more fun&#38;quot; readings classics on screen versus in print.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Is there such thing as being offline today? My first social network: AIM, required a slow and loud [Log-On] as the modem dialed up a connection. When I was done I had to [Log-Off] or my family wouldn&#38;#39;t be able to make phonecalls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Today, Facebook and Google talk to eachother so that between the two of them I am always lgoged in. In addition to actually &#38;quot;logging out&#38;quot; (which I don&#38;#39;t do unless I&#38;#39;m on a shared computer, and computers are less shared than ever before) I can [Go Invisible], allowing me to simulate the now obsolete peace and quiet of disconnection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Path, a social networking app, has buttons for both [Go to Sleep] and [Wake Up]. This isn&#38;#39;t just semantics, it&#38;#39;s a fundamental shift in our relationship to technology. We have been drawn closer and zipped in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>In _Why We Build_ (p. ##), Wilson Miner, formerly a designer at Apple, asks &#38;quot;What is your time-to-screen in the morning? 5 seconds? 30 seconds?&#38;quot; For me, it&#38;#39;s more like zero seconds. When we design for the screen, Miner notes, &#38;quot;We&#38;#39;re not just making pretty interfaces, we&#38;#39;re in the process of building an environment where we&#38;#39;ll spend most of our time for the rest of our lives. What do we want that environment to feel like? What do we want to feel like?&#38;quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Charlie Lloyd&#38;#39;s _Angry Reverie on Software_ (p. ##) notes that people grapple with technology in ways that are completely their own: &#38;quot; I know someone who lives in a mossy cabin in the woods and loves watching Mythbusters on their iPhone, and I know a programmer who wants to colonize Mars but thinks phones are dehumanizing, and these are not exceptions. Almost everyone is complicated.&#38;quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Just recently, with the proliferation of high pixel density displays, branded by Apple as &#38;quot;Retina,&#38;quot; we&#38;#39;ve seen advances in screens. Early reports show that typefaces feel at once beautiful and unsettling, as they never been seen in such sharp detail&#38;sbquo;&#38;Auml;&#38;icirc;moreso even than print. It has been suggested that designers might have to add imperfections in at random, or somehow file down the edges, or risk falling into a typographic uncanny valley. Or, more likely, it is us who will adapt to this sharpness, as the first film audiences ran out of the theatre screaming, for fear of being hit by an oncoming train. At some point too, I seemed to notice airsickness bags disappear from airplans&#38;sbquo;&#38;Auml;&#38;icirc;or be featured less prominently, as humans are perhaps evlolving to stomach being shot through the air at over a thousand miles per hour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>## Beyond screens</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>As evidenced by Greenfield&#38;#39;s _Everyware_, these revolutions in technology may be more cyclical than linear, but their way the form and content of Infinite Scroll have expiration dates built in. We will move beyond screens, or they will become so ubiquitous that we will stop being able to differentiate worlds on and off screen. But the methods exist outside of any particular time: questioning media, aggregating opinions, collating discussions, running experiments. And the qualities of a print magazine rather compliment life on screen: rigorous editing and illuminating design provide a respite from screens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>For future-proofing, a text and media archive will be made available for download. Access to raw content will hopefully underscore the role that a printed magazine can actually play in harboring this discussion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Infinite Scroll refers to a common design pattern found in screen design today: when you reach the end, a loading indicator spins up for a moment before</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still very scattered, yes. But I kind of powered through a first iteration of design. Here are <a href="http://dribbble.com/CaseyG">Dribbble sized</a> peeks:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1nyp2jHNE1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" />

<p>I started thinking about qualities of screens or opposites. If screens are glassy and light emitting, maybe the magazine should be printed on soft, light-absorbent BLACK VELVET. Maybe I'm going crazy. Still haven't landed on whether or not it makes sense to imitate/mimic screens or complement them by opposing them, but I'm having fun. Excited to work more on this, actually. Right now it pretty instantly telegraphs a computer-y shlockiness with a little bit of what somebody described as "how-do-you-stomach-that-irony." But I like that. There is a goddamn pop up ad on the cover! Going to play more and then Kickstart this shit lolol.</p>

<p>Again, went to bed right after class, beat. This week has really been super successful in terms of putting my head down and digging myself out of the bit of a hole I was in. And projects are moving along with gusto on all fronts! So lots on my plate but no complaints.</p>

<p>Tonight will be co-showing SweatyTube again in sculpture, this time with Aaron. Who knows how that will go, it's a very different group dynamic.</p>

<p>Then knocking items off my to-do list before bussing down to Baltimore this weekend with the roommates, where Aaron has a show opening and we will get to tromp around with Natalie! Yay.</p>

            <h3>Good morning.</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning I got up a few hours before usual, before most of New York even, to do work. But it turned out that Avery, who I hadn't seen since middle school, was passing through town. So we had coffee for a few hours and caught up because she doesn't have a Facebook, so I didn't even have vague notions about what her life is like. That was cool to hear about. It's insane to talk to people who knew you well when you were a lot younger. Really checks any current attitudes and how things have changed.</p>

<p>Two people recently told me something to the effect of "it's cool how you do what you want." A nice complement. BUT it's funny because my version of "doing what I want" is more like "<em>not</em> doing what I <em>don't</em> want." (A fancy term for procrastination.) Which I'm usually actively <em>anxious</em> about! So: looks like an attitude, feels like a disability, Jonah Lehrer could probably write an article about why it's a superpower ugh.</p>

<p>Showed SweatyTube in photo, which was pretty much a cop out on my part. Though a meme generator is closer to my interest in photo than straight photography. The conversations were all pretty short but it might've started to get heated if I talked less and it went on longer. I had some misunderstandings corrected and noted that it's hard, or just weird, to show a website to people who don't necessarily know how to make one. They don't know what kind of work goes into it, they don't know what part you made. It just looks like a thing. I should be happy about this! Like really happy. Since I'm always bitching about sculptors getting away with crappy ideas and nice craftsmanship. Computer things that people don't fully understand are the perfectly fabricated objects I've always been envious of.</p>

<p>Still haven't turned in a proposal for censorship even though I was/am brimming with ideas. Just laziness. I think about procrastination as reverse-magnetism all the time.</p>

<p>In other news, I am fucking tired of looking at and working on a draft of this 2.5 weeknote. I have shit to do. A hole to dig myself out of in the next six hours. Two older, unfinished attempts at weeknoting follow. Beware of splintered sentences and malformed opinions. Good riddance.</p>

<h3>Here's what I wrote in the car on the way back to Brooklyn from Rye:</h3>

<h3>Spring Break</h3>

<p>Have been on SpRiNg BrEaK this week, so at home in the suburbs. Arrived home with my parade of devices, a bag of laundry, and a big to-do list. And didn't really accomplish any of it. Which is okay. Since it was a break. But this week will be difficult — and the catchup may be impossible — because many of those things were overdue tasks from last week.</p>

<p>I don't have a problem starting new projects, from adding something to my to-do list to getting a good portion of it done. The problem is that if I don't send something off into the world after a few sittings it tends to get stuck in a loop of unfinishability, where I either don't want to look at it until it slips out the back of my mind OR it sucks up unwarranted amounts of time and energy until it makes it out of the gauntlet of perfectionism. For example, I've been writing and rewriting a bunch of essay proposals for multiple weeks when it probably should've taken a day at most. Or maybe an hour a day across a week. They're just proposals! Need to get better at pushing things to good <em>enough</em> and then letting them go. Could use the extra brainspace. Doesn't matter if things are in pieces. Weeknotes are sort of part of that, but most of this weeknote has sat in my drafts for a week. Grr.</p>

<p>That said, did work on non-work during the break. (Which is maybe how it should be.) Pulled together updated projects for my website, which is pretty out of date at the moment, and started building a new interface: a filterable grid of tagged projects that maps connections between things when you hover. The whole thing is a series of toggles, so you can toggle between a list and a grid, toggle tags on and off, toggle projects open and closed, and toggle images regular to zoomed. Maybe too much clicking, but the whole thing was mostly an excuse to teach myself more about Javascript/jQuery and canvas. Finally felt Javascript click for the first time. Still a lot of bugs to squash and details to figure out. How can I save this the unfinishable loop?? Gah.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m18soaAoZC1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Between making little improvements to SweatyTube and my new site, I basically became nocturnal and almost died of prolonged-staring-at-screen-sickness, like Marie Curie handling too much radioactive stuff. It reminded me, though, that I haven't had uninterrupted work periods like when I am at my computer in the middle of the night, for way too long. Maybe I need more of that, minus the insanity and grumpiness.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m18sr24Pru1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There was <em>one</em> day where friends came from the city and we took Sneezeburg to the beach, played a boring game of monopoly, and ate dinner outside. That was really fun. And I went on a few nice walks with Niki and Sneeze.</p>

<h3>Here's what I wrote a week ago:</h3>

<p>Trying something a little different this week. Instead of the laborious day-by-day-log, I am pulling out things-that-happened.</p>

<h3>Met the internet at Max's</h3>

<p>Sunday walked up to Max's in Greenpoint. Don't usually walk that far north, so enjoyed looking around the neighborhood. Met a lot of people who I have known only on Twitter: @tcarmody, @kissane, @meetar, @stuntbox, @tealtan. Now just Tim, Erin, Peter, David, Allen. Also Marcy and Other Max. Old friends showed up too: David and Sara. Somehow we ended up talking for a little while about how awkward it is to meet people you admire, which was funny for me because Twitter people and other random internet folks <em>are</em> my celebrities. If only because I have chosen to have my head filled with tabloid-level mundane details of these smart people's lives. Thanks, Twitter. Did I mention being in a room with people whose blogs I read? Okay. So, I hovered on the edge of blacking out of overwhelmedness for a few hours while we all hung out and ate lobster rolls(!) and then walked home. It was fun. I have such a small, insular circle of people whom I'm ridiculously comfortable around at school and home, so every meet-the-internet-IRL situation I've ever been in has felt nerve-wracking. A couple of months ago I started to think about all the people I know online who live in New York and how silly it is that we never meet. Started imagining structures for meeting them, along the lines of "conversations I want to have". But Max is just a gracious host and that's all there is to it. Doh.</p>

<p>It's a very different pace hanging out with older people. That doesn't sound like a compliment to them! But it is. I am glad I have gotten to see my older friends recently and make new ones. A reality-check and college brain bubble bursting and hope for the near future type of deal.</p>

<h3>Systems / Angry Reverie On Software</h3>

<p>I joked with David that I was sitting by my inbox all week hitting refresh, waiting to hear from Kevin about the Systems essays. I didn't really want to share the page before hearing from him but figured there was no sense in keeping secrets from my weeknotes about what I had been working on. So I basically just buried the lede, passing over it like any other thing that had happened that week. But The Internet picked it right out and started talking(!), which was totally unexpected and exciting.</p>

<p><script src="http://storify.com/caseyg/twitter-responds-to-systems.js?header=false&#38;amp;sharing=false&#38;amp;border=false" type="text/javascript"></script><noscript></p>

<div>[<a href="http://storify.com/caseyg/twitter-responds-to-systems" target="_blank">View the story "Twitter Responds to Systems" on Storify</a>]</div>

<p></noscript></p>

<p>Peter linked me to <a href="http://basecase.org/env/Facebook">Charlie Loyd's beautiful rant</a> on software and other related topics, which rocked my world. I mean, just read this, it's so GOOD:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;‎"If you see computers with an idea of what they could be, most of what they are is confusing. Here is this gorgeous medium, this trail into the sunny uplands, this multitool for brains, this sampo for science and empowerment, liberation, and we end up with hundreds of millions of people spending their days at keyboards, mice, windows, and Windows®, doing drudge work, clicking rude and semiliterate dialog boxes – and billions of people carrying amazing computers that charade as a slight step up from rotary telephones.</p>

<p>&#38;gt;Triple ugh.</p>

<p>&#38;gt;I would like more people to see how much of a disaster this is. I think some competent software people are alert, although obviously not enough to make usable bookmark managers or ATMs that don’t put a twitch in my eyelid. What worries me most today is that users (a word for victims of things like heroin and tobacco but here meaning people who consume but do not produce software) are just going to get more alienated from it. “Computers” will become inexplicable things, Other things, inhuman things, irresistible and noncontingent and unreasonable, absurd, meaningless, ahistoric interlopers in culture, boring at best.</p>

<p>I found it funny to learn, after messaging him, that he has a hard time reading back over it, because I do with mine too. Yet we apparently like eachother's things. A reminder that everyone should probably just get over their stupid embarrassment about things they make.</p>

<p>Kevin's response finally arrived and it was tough love, as expected. He wants me to get out of my head which, I was going to write is something scary for me to think about, but actually is something I should just not think about at all because that is some circular ass bullshit. Lukas told me last week that Sarah was describing people as having either their head, their eyes, or their feet in their mouths — an interesting metaphor — and I was her example of head in mouth. It's tricky to be at Cooper, which as a visual arts program is very eye-in-mouth-y and be head-in-mouth-y.</p>

<p>We'll make plans to meet soon and talk about going beyond just synthesis and reflection. That's really exciting.</p>

<h3>Social Practice Douchebaggery / A Talk With Kaila</h3>

<p>On Monday evening we all met again to decide what should become of Work Makes Work. Everyone still seemed burned out. It basically came down to leaving the space as is or clearing out the space, and then maybe playing a game of soccer in either of those configurations. We talked in circles and made jokes. As a strange twist, Porter, Kaila's boyfriend and a member of Group 2, came to kind of observe and participate in the meeting because he had caught wind of our plan to "do nothing" and was concerned by it. It changed the passionless dynamic because he showed up with hurt feelings about the whole thing. That happened to remind me why I was angry. The group was sort of split on whether or not somebody's feelings should be a deciding factor in making decisions about what we do. I don't want to hurt people's feelings, but I made it clear that I don't believe they should be a consideration. Shit's complicated and people hopefully get attached to things and it's okay to feel feelings but when it comes to talking about and critiquing art, fear of hurting the artist's feelings should not get in the way, in my opinion. Especially if you are part of an ostensibly open and participatory (and problematic!) structure they set up for you to "collaborate" within. Porter and I eventually just respectfully agreed that we don't see eye to eye on things. It felt horribly and weirdly like a breakup.</p>

<p>The next day nobody from the group did anything. But to my surprise Kaila and Porter did. They erased the chalkboards, laid them on the floor, and scattered the red flags that had been attached to the previous iteration's artworks. On the wall there was a note: "Thanks —WMW". I felt disappointed at having a sweet and tidy ending thrust upon us.</p>

<p>Kaila and I rode and elevator together more silently than usual and then the next time we bumped she asked to talk about the whole thing, to which I agreed. We sat outside in the sun, this was on Wednesday, and talked about the whole thing for a long time. Her biggest issue was that she had worked hard to put this together and she felt I was being mean in the way I was talking, writing, and participating in the show, without being smart of critical. I admitted that I had posted some bitchy things here and in email threads, but that I didn't do it to hurt the feelings of a friend, and I hope that fear of causing negative feelings can be kept out of making and talking about work.</p>

<p>[Just re-read this two weeks later and I hate how standoffish the tone is. Ew, me. Sorry Kaila. Didn't finish what I wanted to say at the time, either.]</p>

<iframe width="500" height="254" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IG8KvKHYQSc?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Comparing social practice to douchebags. I think this video is a metaphor. I still don't know if it's worth making fun of. I think I just have to. But ultimately that's not where kaila was coming from at all and I feel sorry for having aggressively redirected her well-intentioned project.</p>

<h3>Sweatytube</h3>

<p>We must've been sitting around the apartment dicking around on the internet as usual when Aaron said something about how cool it would be if you could watch videos on sweaters. Like, I need a new sweater, let me go watch some videos on YouTube. And then you could print any moment of any video onto a sweater. There's your hipster startup idea.</p>

<p>Alex became kind of a big deal for photoshopping things onto sweaters on his Tumblr <a href="http://badsmellingboy.com">Bad Smelling Boy</a>. He is sort-of-unbelievably credited as the inventor of this trend on <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sexy-sweaters">Know Your Meme</a>.</p>

<p>But later that night I had a prototype of a translucent sweater PNG overlaying a YouTube player up and running. Aaron tweaked Alex's sweater graphic for maximum see-through effect while I ironed out bugs and added features. Wednesday I was so entranced by sweater videos that I couldn't focus on my homework. EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOD ON A SWEATER. It adds a weird layer of meaning/meaninglessness that makes me laugh and induces self-loathing.</p>

<p>I showed up to design 15 minutes late and literally empty handed. But Bad Smelling Tube (as we were calling it) was cross-browser compatible and had grown a fancy slide-in (all CSS animated) form that accepts any variation of YouTube URL as an input (PHP regex) and displays leaderboards of recent and popular videos on the site (with no backed or database, thanks to the Clicky stats API). Within the next day or two I grabbed the domains SweatyTube.com, fixed bugs with liking and tweeting, and integrated the bit.ly API to auto generate sweatytu.be short URLs for sharing. It was fun to hack a stupid idea into a real thing in almost no time.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0uqnmeU1y1qzrmn8.png" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0uqnuoizF1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few good and weird Sweaty Tubes:
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/y7Nebm">100 Most Viewed Videos in 200 Seconds</a>
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/wo2f2U">Koyaanisqatsi</a>
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/xXgX4t">Fast Car by Tracy Chapman</a>
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/wbJb8Z">The Sweater Song</a>
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/zutSXa">Marina Abramovic</a>
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/AEP2Hc">JFK Assassination</a>
<a href="http://sweatytu.be/yC0yRl">Me at the Zoo (The First YouTube Video Ever)</a></p>

<p>While it wasn't viral like we had built ourselves up to think it would be as we were putting it together, it satisfyingly puts a bad joke to rest by opening it up. Anyone can put anything on a sweater, it no longer even request opening photoshop. A meme masquerading as something more was cut back down to its rightful place by an automatic generator.</p>

<h3>___ Days Since Accident</h3>

<p>Speaking of my design class to which I showed up empty handed. Uh oh. I am in a dangerous place, I was told by Warren. In my head I have a mental counter, like the ones at construction sites that say “___ days since accident”, except mine has to do with professors being like "what the fuck are you DOING?!" So, as Warren and I talked briefly after class I was flipping that number back to 0 in my head. Oops.</p>

<p>However, I am glad I went to class because it is helpful to hear about what other people are working on.</p>

<p>I have some overly-heady/abstract ideas about what I want to work on. Maybe an evolution of Process, and the way that dealt with raw, transcribed conversations and printed whispers of hypertext. I've also been thinking about my own cynicism and perfectionism. Claire Bishop's rejection of affirmative criticism. A place where people write about what bothers them until they get to the core of it. Maybe structures for understanding too, like 5 Whys, or back and forth.</p>

<h3>Combinatorial Creativity / Curator's Code / Xanadu / Workflow</h3>

<p>Everyone already wrote about this but still want to.</p>

<h3>Onward</h3>

            <p>It is spring, dammit. And the past two weeks of my life have been like an ad for New York state. Last Thursday I was on the beach (which is what threw off my regularly scheduled weeknote, as I normally use that chunk of time to pull it together), on Friday I was skiing(!!!) on a mountain(!!) to celebrate mom's birthday, and in between there was the city.</p>

<p>It's very typical of my way of getting things done (or, rather, not done) that I fuck up "routines" almost instantaneously and then push work out indefinitely as it accrues into unmanageable sized tasks. Like this one-and-something week overdue post, for example.</p>

<p>So, I can't even remember most days, especially the ones I have to myself, and on top of that decided not to check-in or send emails or leave followable traces. Freaky how that happens. Having botched my routine of laying out ideas on a regular interval for myself to refer back to, I've also found myself falling into the trap of telling myself (and others), "I haven't been thinking or working on <em>anything</em>!" Oh god.</p>

<p>Memory is fallible, but mine (in the short term) is just busted.</p>

<p>Hummingbird mind.</p>

<p>I'm tired of the chronological log but too weary to replace what's already written.</p>

<p>Last Thursday night I met up with Tori, my design TA from a bunch of years ago at a RISD summer program, and her girlfriend Whitney, for dinner. Really fun to hear about life after school. Also, buying a student a good dinner is pretty much the best thing you can do as a person ever, in my book.</p>

<p>Friday, walked across the bridge with Aaron and Alex and got a doughnut from Doughnut Plant! That is all I remember about this day. The doughnut was just okay??</p>

<p>Saturday morning I was browsing around and somehow landed on the Amazon page for N. Katherine Hayles' <em>My Mother Was a Computer</em>, which I've been wanting to read and was on sale for $5, so I bought that and started reading it.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzxhnyPqwB1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>She gave a lecture at Cooper a while back and it is just hilariously unexpected to watch somebody who looks like my granny use the word "gigabyte". But she knows more about this than I ever will.</p>

<p>Kindles have all sorts of funny typographic bugs that look a lot like the way letters wiggle around on a letterpress when they're not locked up tightly enough. Maybe this book is just really poorly formatted, because it's also ridden with hyphens in the middle of lines. I hate how most publishers don't even seem to give their e-books a once-over.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzxhnpiO8f1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Headed up to MoMA with Aaron to see some sort of presentation on interactive something. But the subway broke down and basically dumped us in Times Square, where it seems like I end up a lot these days. This is a bus full of turistas who were sitting sideways facing the window and ROCKING OUT.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzxhputpXI1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We literally sprinted through Times Square up to 53rd st but by the time we reached MoMA tickets for our event were already sold out. Instead we grabbed tickets to <a href="http://ivanandivana.com/">Ivan and Ivana</a> by Jeff Silva and checked out the galleries a little. Spent a little more time in the Sharon Hayes &#38;amp; co. <em>9 Scripts for a Nation at War</em>, a really well done show, and also jogged through In <a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1243">Print In</a> (or Print Out? I forget), which I think wasn't even open when I was here last week. Sat for a while with a piece by Simon Fujiwara where you kneel on a tatami mat and watch a fictionalized interview with the artist in which he puts on a thick Japanese accent and pretends his formative years hinged on Huckleberry Finn. Liked that a lot.</p>

<p>Ivan and Ivana was really good. While in Kosovo filming for another project, he met this couple and decided to make a documentary about them. There is a whole political conflict going on there that caused them to leave, but the movie basically takes place in suburban California, where they try to live the American-dream-or-whatever. It was really meandering, but I've always wished for more movies where nothing really happens, without such a distinct plot. It was interesting to hear Jeff talk about how he decided to end the movie. There was a sort of turning point for the characters but he mostly just thought it wouldn't go anywhere if he kept filming. Starting and ending it where he did were really well made intuitive decisions. Over the course of filming they became his best friends and that intimacy is really apparent in the movie.</p>

<p>The audience at MoMA was OUT OF CONTROL HORRIBLE. A group of old people behind us didn't really stop talking loudly for the entire time despite glares from multiple people in the audience. They even kept talking through the Q&#38;amp;A, and just as I decided to shush them (which I hate doing) they were like, "let's get outta here!" Then a lady asked what the director makes of Ivan's sense of entitlement, after he had just told us they're his best friends. He was like, I don't really think he has a sense of entitlement. And then she kept talking to herself for a few minutes while he answered other questions. All the while, people kept getting up and leaving in droves every couple of minutes. Jeff was like, "uhh...it looks like you guys are tired so I'll just take one more question." So embarrasing it was almost surreal. Stupid rude old people.</p>

<p>Sunday met Mom and Niki for lunch at Ippudo, which was amazing, as always. There must've been a tear in the fabric of the universe because we got a table in 5 minutes. Then we walked down to Chinatown, got bubble tea, and ducked in and out of different places looking for someone who would repair Niki's cracked iPhone screen. Everybody was watching basketball on laptops, in restaurants, through store windows. Finally dropped Niki's phone off with some guy who said he'd fix it in two hours for $30. Then walked through a cool underground mall. Tried to get Niki and Mom to walk over the bridge with me because I had to go home and do work and they had time to kill, but they were tired (people don't walk in the suburbs), hungry, cold, and didn't want to leave the area. Sort of a crappy goodbye, for which we both apologized quickly, but it was fun to see them. Turns out that the guy wanted $130, so they made him put the broken screen back on.</p>

<p>The bridge was awesome!</p>

<p>Got a coffee at Blue Bottle and pulled out my laptop (which always feels like a crime, there) to work on the systems rants I posted last week. Went to Best Pizza for the first time and really liked it. The crust!</p>

<p>Monday, walked up into Greenpoint. Had a crazy good egg bagel at Baker's Dozen. Worked outside on a bench in the sun for a while at Cafe Grumpy, then got another coffee and walked home to work on systems. Today was the deadline I had set with Kevin for re-evaluating my grade from last semester — in the process I have been building a coffee tower in my room — but I am mostly just excited to talk more with him about systems than to get a better grade.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cmxgcMyI1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Systems stuff has been consuming my mind.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>listening to @<a href="https://twitter.com/britneyspears">britneyspears</a>, writing essays about the terror of systems</p>     <div><a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/171797600503209984">February 21, 2012</a></div></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Built a web template for the four sort-of-essays, but wasn't done midnight, so I sent Kevin and email saying STAY TUNED. Worked until 4am before stopping to briefly rest my eyes. But accidentally passed out...</p>

<p>Tuesday morning I was racing to finish the systems page. Got to photo after 2, a little late and very bleary-eyed. We learned how to use an Imacon scanner, which is like a $20,000 monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey, that turns film into super high quality digital files. We got out pretty early and I pinched myself for not really making progress on photo since last week, or even the week before. Got EVThai with Aaron (so good) and then finished the page in my studio and sent it to Kevin!! Here's the first screen:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cmxpCHC31qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here's  a really zoomed out view, since it's 32,767 pixels long:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cplyv9cX1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://caseyagollan.com/public/systems">Here it is</a>. I have no idea what to think of it for a while. Or if it's enough. Mostly need some time away away away from this.</p>

<p>Went home, rocked out to all the international versions of Avril Lavigne's <em>Girlfriend</em> with Alex and Aaron — which is just such an awesomely fucked up example of globalization at work — and then blacked out from exhaustion.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning I woke up early, got coffee, and headed to school attempting to work on Publication Design. Saw a limo parked outside McDonalds! I think there were people in the limo who made their driver go in for them.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzxhu71IA51qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have no idea what it feels like to give birth but I felt like I had the day before, to the systems thing, and today I felt — pardon this horrible extended metaphor — saggy.</p>

<p>We had two weeks to do this portion of design work, but again I didn't start until the day it was due (IDIOT) and this morning I was particularly distracted. Couldn't bring myself to touch the work. Mostly because I REALLY don't want to be working on a coffee table book about peoples' bitchy second-homes in the Hudson Valley. So, went out and got a sandwich and another coffee, and did the reading assignment, which was <em>Designer as Author</em> by Michael Rock. Also read his essay <em>Fuck Content</em>. Still didn't do the work.</p>

<p>Instead of working composed <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/maxfenton/status/172377295787524096">elaborate emoji tweets</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0djx8MXlk1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, at the point where it became clear I wasn't going to even start the work in time for class, Alex and I went and got oysters(!) and burgers at Balthazar. BAD LIFE CHOICES! But SUCH GOOD ONES! WAH HA!</p>

<p>Skipped class and went to go see the <a href="http://workmakeswork.org">Work Makes Work</a> opening. There was hardly any art there. Bread with nothing on it and oversteeped tea was served. It was bad. Don't feel like talking about it anymore after already spending so many words on something not worth criticizing.</p>

<p>Thursday morning had Western Theories. Didn't do the readings. Daydreamed about napping on a beach, and when I was called on to answer some questions I was like, "Hmmmmm...I don't know!" But I don't hate that class because I like Weinstein so much. There is too much reading. This is the one class where I wish the teacher would talk AT us more, since he's so smart and the class usually has nothing to contribute or it takes a long time.</p>

<p>The weather was incredible. Incredible! So lots of people were outside playing soccer and I was climbing and stretching on the building.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cpwzbtaW1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we actually decided to go to the beach since nobody had class until 6. Jumped on the R and soon enough we were at Coney Island, which felt like a world away. Got corndogs and cheese fries at Nathans (which felt weirdly like the best party ever, because of their music that was blasting) and then headed towards the beach.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cpw719GB1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I don't even remember sculpture. It was whatever.</p>

<p>Don't remember Friday, except slopping through Times Square to Dad's in the rain. Ordered Daisy May's and Dad and Niki didn't love it. (I was surprised, even though it was less good than I remembered, too.) But roommates were excited about the leftovers.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzxhw19Fr31qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Went to the suburbs on Saturday for a doctor's appointment and spent the day at home.</p>

<p>Last time I saw Sara I (awkwardly) didn't really stop because we were on the bridge and I had momentum and a spat of faceblindness. So we arranged to get coffee on Saturday but I bumped into her in the morning, which was funny. Aren't there supposed to be like 7 zillion people in this city?</p>

<p>Discovered Amarin thai in Greenpoint, which was one of those moments like, how long have I been alive with this so close by and not known about it? Happens the most with food and books. Then walked over to Bakeri, stopping first at that uglygorgeous little beach:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0dkqsb5Um1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Had a really great funny long conversation with Sara about art, life, and everything else. Have had lots of talks with older people recently and it's exciting to get that kind of perspective. Left feeling really happy. Could've written more about it right after the fact but now it's just fuzzy happiness.</p>

<p>Monday worked on some essay proposals and made lots of progress on the freelance web project I'm working on.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>trying to draw like buttons but they're turning out like dicks ugh <a href="http://t.co/ArQ8Zi0J" title="http://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/174234510433583104/photo/1">twitter.com/CaseyG/status/…</a></p>     <div><a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyG/status/174234510433583104">February 27, 2012</a></div></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>Seems like fun was had at school but glad to have finally gotten some work done. Let it go down in history that Alex and shawn started wearing their wigs today. A joke that won't end.</p>

<p><a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/deploy/"><em>Deploy</em> by Mandy Brown</a> stole Monday's internet.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, had photo and censorship. Still haven't really moved forward with photo. Yikes. That evening I stumbled onto the final group trying to shift the Work Makes Work show, whichhas bothered my thoughts an embarrasing amount, and sort of joined their group. Things were written on chalkboards.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0dlglkfZL1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0dlhuUiLJ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Jokes, insults, and thoughts were thrown around in a fiery way for two hours, then everyone departed, I think exhausted. Hate the show but like the group. Question my involvement as a (recovering?/unrelenting?) troll and ability to be a good participant in group work.</p>

<p>Spent all of Wednesday catching up on Publication Design. Can't say I enjoyed it but got mostly out of my pit of undone work. Took a break to have ice cream w/ Kris Gibbs, who was in town briefly from Philly. Nice to see her so often, she talks the fastest and loudest. Interesting how different PAFA is. Made a note to make it down there in May for her end of year show and a trip to the Barnes collection. Later had a WMW meeting and everyone was hungover in the sense of ideas. Apathy ran wild. It felt crappy.</p>

<p>Thursday had a great class with Weinstein. Don't remember what I did all day. Left sculpture after 10 minutes to go home because I felt drained.</p>

<p>Friday morning got an early start and drove(!) upstate to ski as a fun trip to celebrate mom's birthday.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cmsvaG6P1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was great. Followed by the world's largest kaleidoscope? Upstate hippies are weird.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cmu0V0md1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Headed back to Brooklyn. Took a cab in the rain with the roommates to a fun party where I danced hard. Like everybody, myself included, getting grossed out about how much I was sweating, hard. Took a cab back to BK late with Alex. Hung out at home for a little while and then walked over to the diner with Aaron in the middle of the night. Of course, in New York, it is full. And a fist fight breaks out. And the girl sitting alone reading and eating disco fries at the table across throws a sugar packet at us as a joke and says "all hell is going to break loose!" And I'm like, "don't try and start shit!" And then she plops over to our table and introduces herself as Lady Valtronic. And we talk about insomnia and mexican sorcery and lucid dreaming for a few hours. New friends:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0dm16s05p1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sometimes the city is wild in the best possible way. Got home and fell asleep at 6am.</p>

<p>Saturday, got coffee and a bagel and headed up to the Whitney (in a roundabout way, thanks to the broken L) where I met Mom, Niki and Suzy. We looked at the Biennial, which felt small, but I don't know what I was expecting. It's a tiny building, and I'm sasd that they'll be leaving it. I'm kind of in love with brutalist architecture!!</p>

<p>Sat at the "portal" to some old guy who is in a band (Red Crayons?) while he skyped with museum visitors as he was driving around. It was pretty pretty banal, fun, awkward, lame, fun. There was a gigantic sketchbook there and on the first page all the VIPs had signed "Jerry Saltz" "Paddy Johnson Art Fag City" and it got more freeform after that. Some people drew him or wrote little notes, there were a good number of trolling comments like this one:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cms5CpXQ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was grateful to sit and close my eyes for a while in the Werner Herzog video room, to the music of Ernst Reisjiegr. Mom got really into the open studio thing and started talking a lot to the artist. The artist was acting really earnest and excited. Despite attempts to invite the audience in, most stood against the wall of the hallway. Her studio looked like a studio. I guess I could go back and spend more time but I wonder if it's worth $12. I forgot to ask her if she is getting paid or if this is like a residency. I feel like it would be stupid to think too hard about it because the whole thing is so simple. It made me realize how hard I think or overthink things. This is just her piece in the museum. So simple I almost don't get it.</p>

<p>Walked back to Cooper from The Whitney (like 70 blocks!) and fell asleep in my studio for 20 minutes. Had a Work Makes Work meeting with Kristi, Moriah, and Audrey that was sort of bleh. The jokes are so good, though.</p>

<p>Thought I would have dinner with Dad so waited around in my studio, but he fell asleep with his phone under a pillow and wasn't getting my calls until a lot later. Grabbed curry and walked to the L before realizing it wasn't working. Maybe about to collapse of hunger and tired-ness, grabbed a cab back to BK. I will regret my cab spending soon enough.</p>

<p>Watched the Bieber movie, did a round of DIY Karaoke, and went to bed.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cmrnAdSE1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Good riddance with this recap. Now off to see Max!</p>

            <p>Last week I totally forgot to write about an amazing part of Wednesday: the wreath laying ceremony to celebrate Peter Cooper's birthday. In protest of how much Jamshed sucks Kylie and Rachel were going to put a plexiglass box around the Peter statue, blocking him from the stupid ceremonial wreath laying. But that didn't work out because the scepter sticks out diagonally.</p>

<p>I passive-agressively put post-it letters on the event sign:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzi4tlMgMz1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>(they were taken down so fast)</p>

<p>Lena and Jasmine took off their shirts!</p>

<p>(via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/friendsofcooperunion/">Friends of Cooper Union</a>)</p>

<p>The administration was pretty effectively made uncomfortable. Apparently they cut the alma mater song (that this guy was singing) short a few verses to get it over with and say goodbye to everyone.</p>

<p>Maybe <em>Jambashed</em> will be the solution to Cooper's financial problems?</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzi6bj5OX41qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On Friday morning I sent off a paper proposal for censorship about how money has essentially been dematerialized into form of centrally held information that can be censored. Not exactly censorship...but excited to try connecting  <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> with ubiquitous computing forewarnings from Adam Greenfield's <em>Everyware</em>.</p>

<p>Walked up to Madison Square Park for lunch at Shake Shack with David, which was delicious. We shouted in catch-up-y excitement about monomania and <a href="37signals.com/svn/posts/3106-all-or-something">all or something projects</a> and New York Startups&#38;trade;. He told me about how things work infrastructurally in India vs. the US (rearchitecting vs. bandaids) which sounds like insanity.</p>

<p>Afterwards walked up to MoMA. Normally don't sit through videos (especially on loops) but watched a good amount of Godard's <em>Historie(s) du cinéma</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lziymrnbpT1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lziymwZGCQ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ate a Félix González-Torres candy, while is always a strange relief when museum-fatigued. There is a DRONE in the rotating contemporary art section. Noticed they are installing Rikrit's annoying curry thing in a big way. Loved these video pedestals from <a href=""><em>9 Scripts from a Nation at War</em></a> (Sharon Hayes and co.) because they feel almost exactly like sitting at a computer alone at night.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzi4v4XdTm1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walked(!) back to school. (That's like 8 miles in one day! But who's counting? Fitness is kind of my new thing.) A flyer-person in the gold-buying-district(?) practically shouted me down about how his gold buying establishment will fill my pockets with so much money I won't even know what to do with myself. Goofy. Had a great call about a freelance web project I'm excited to be starting. Headed back into the city and played video games with friends into the night. Not as good as I remember myself to be from growing up. In fact, I am terrible. But the city is a bigger pond.</p>

<p>Saturday headed home for a doctor's appointment. Finished a final round of tweaks on the Girl Walk site. Watched South Park with Niki. Woke up just as I was falling asleep and scribbled things down, a little bit about photography and a lot about systems (for which my grade re-evaluation presentation is fast approaching).</p>

<p>Sunday, pulled together a cover letter, updated résumé, and references for a summer internship at the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center for Internet &#38;amp; Society at Harvard</a>!! Already wishing I could rewrite the cover letter because I could so do a better job and I REALLY hope I get this. Would be incredible to spend a summer at <a href="metalab.harvard.edu">metaLab</a> (their research areas map uncannily to my obsessions) or the <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media lab</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzj1pbvxJz1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then went out to a too-expensive dinner at Porsena with Alex and he talked to me about painting. Which must've been like trying to explain to an alien how to open a door knob.</p>

<p>Monday morning I got coffee and perused the internet for a long time:</p>

<p>Kelli's <a href="http://kellianderson.com/blog/2012/02/my-tedx-talk/">TEDx Talk</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://sexpigeon.org/post/17557073915/two-billion-dollars-do-you-know-what-you-could">Surrealist politics</a> by Sexpigeon (which is maybe the best website): "It is predicted that total spending on television advertising in the Presidential race will reach two billion dollars. Two billion dollars! Do you know what you could do with that kind of money? Abort every fetus, embryo, and zygote in the nation AND marry every gay person in the United States AND still have $4 million left over."</p>

<p>I must've subscribed to Cornell's robotics lab on YouTube a while ago, because I received this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#38;amp;v=v46QP55NLrw">incredible video</a> in my inbox.</p>

<p>The internet, interface design, and social networks were on my mind. Left a long comment on Brad's post and kind of felt like my work for the day was done.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzi3puYMaH1qzrd3yo1_1280.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ6IHWSU3BX3X7X3Q&#38;amp;Expires=1329507302&#38;amp;Signature=nGHLqCcaWReADgNqwQfTql%2FzC64%3D" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walked to school over the bridge and asked lots of questions at an informal <a href="http://www.workmakeswork.org/">Work Makes Work</a> meeting. Tried to finish a proposal for Triple Canopy based on long-unresolved <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/2011/notes-on-forgetting-archiving-and-existing-on-the-internet/">Notes on Forgetting, Archiving, Existing on the Internet</a>, but ADD'd out, deciding instead to walk over the bridge (again!), home, with Alex, which was worth it. Anyway, I wasn't totally sure if the notes made sense or how to pitch it as an essay proposal (with a budget, etc?!) at the last minute (obviously). But loooord knows an editor (ideally following me around all day) would help. Regardless, the deadline proved to be a helpful reminder to work on this.</p>

<p>Tuesday, Shakira got attacked by <a href="http://onionlike.tumblr.com/post/17610732746/shakira-attacked-by-sea-lion">a sea lion</a>. I, on the other hand, sort of merged the Forgetting notes in my head with thinking for Systems about the social network as a future city, and the speculative fictional plot to assassinate Zuckerberg upon his appointment as president of the US. (Maybe a stretch? Though I think if I were Zuckerberg, I would be driven to kill myself from the pressure of being that rich and powerful.) Jaron Lanier writes: "[Technologists] tinker with your philosophy by direct manipulation of your cognitive experience, not indirectly, through argument. It takes only a tiny group of engineers to create technology that can shape the entire future of human experience with incredible speed. Therefore, crucial arguments about the human relationship with technology should take place between developers and users before such direct manipulations are designed."</p>

<p>I re-read <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-ipo-letter/">Zuckerberg's post-IPO Letter</a> and found a lot of the bits about "a social mission — to make the world more open and connected" to be pretty specious, considering it was originally a version of Hot-or-Not. And still, essentially, is.</p>

<p>Downloaded b-roll and saved news clippings. Learned that Facebook flies the flags of state, country, and social network. Can't help but imagining them merge... (via <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/12/facebook-data-center/all/1">wired</a>)

<p>Facebook's internal tools are interesting. Engineers have "push karma" which starts at 4 stars on their first day of work and can only go down if their code breaks things. If an engineer has low push karma their work is scrutinized much more carefully before being allowed to go into the daily pushes (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and especially the big weekly push (Tuesday), which includes thousands of changes.

<p>Stumbled on some ADHD self-help from an old notebook (lol):</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzi450kwo71qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And experimented with <a href="http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/">Pomodoro</a>, an app that mandates 25 minute timed and named sprints of focused work with 5 minutes breaks. It plays a ticking clock sound too. While it's kind of helpful to do a Pomodoro if I'm sitting on my ass, I kept putting off starting the next one because it's kind of a displeasurable way of working for me, so didn't even manage to do two sprints in a row.</p>

<p>Grabbed spicy noodles at Szechuan Gourmet, then wandered around the NYPL's  gorgeous Schwarzman Building before meeting Christine's class there to look at a history of photo prints. The library collects a ton and is happy to show them to the public if you ask nicely and arrange ahead of time. Definitely going back.</p>

<p>Walked back to school! And surfed the internet for a while.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.cowbird.com/post/17611542231/cowbird-inc-a-love-story">Cowbird</a>, which just became an official company instead of just a side-project, is so well designed. The interface feels really springy and just fun to interact with. The site also manages to make the complications of linked data seem ridiculously friendly and intuitive. Jonathan Harris is talented. While the tools are incredible and they're doing a good job cultivating a specific kind of community, I'm not terribly interested in most of the content that's there so far.</p>

<p>The site is also full of great little moments, like this from their FAQ:
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzi53icSrY1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally got around to finishing the readings Christine gave me, though I have to take a closer look at them. This is Gustave Flaubert in 1881:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;"ART
&#38;gt;It makes you ill.
&#38;gt;What use is it? since it can be replaced by machines that do it better and faster.
&#38;gt;
&#38;gt;ARTISTS
&#38;gt;You have to laugh at everything they say.
&#38;gt;All jokers. Boast about their disinterestedness.
&#38;gt;Are astonished that they are dressed like everyone else.
&#38;gt;Earn ridiculous amounts of money, but throw it all away.
&#38;gt;What they do can't be called 'working'.
&#38;gt;Often invited out to dinner."</p>

<p>Maybe a predecessor to this. (via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1747585449262&#38;amp;set=a.1246378919412.2031092.1227570132&#38;amp;type=1&#38;amp;theater">Sofia Leiby</a>)

<p>Later had Censorship, which was good. We read Howl by Ginsburg and excerpts of the trial, all of which I loved. We were then subjected to Franco's embarrasing film adaptation. It wasn't <em>so</em> bad, but the animation sequences were a little barf-inducing. All in all it does a disservice to the writing, I'd say.</p>

<hr />

<p>The rant below, based on this strange graphic I threw together during Systems last semester is meant to be recited in a screaming voice, in protest:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzj4p5p5Ge1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am not a vessel for genetic information.</p>

<p>Saying that you don't believe in genetics is like saying that you don't believe in dinosaurs. But maybe I don't.</p>

<p>Which came first: the chicken or the egg? It doesn't matter, writes Richard Dawkins, eggs are raw genetic information, genetic information simply wants to multiply, and chickens are a means to make more eggs. Humans, he writes, are also just vessels for genetic information. Maybe he doesn't say “just” but you're being a softie if you don't reduce his arguments to this purpose, the multiplication of genetic information. At some point we became sentient blah blah and here we are.</p>

<p>I'm sick and tired of things so vast I can't understand them. Genetics. Capitalism. International relations.</p>

<p>Fucking is comedic on a grand level because it starts to look like a multiplication sign.</p>

<p>Where did this growth curve come from?</p>

<p>We are going to wipe ourselves out and there was never any reason we had to be sentient to worry about it anyway.</p>

<p>What we've uncovered is a problem of language. We have no words to describe intention without mind.</p>

<p>Genius, in an earlier time, was thought to be external. It descended from the heavens and passed through our bodies. We could inhale it and hold it inside of us momentarily at most.</p>

<p>Today genius is internalized, inseparable from persons.</p>

<p>Everything in my experience confirms that I am here. I stretch almost compulsively, feeling out my body's physicality.</p>

<p>Pass the torch to the next generation. None of this matters so I'm going to light up a candy cigarette.</p>

<p>In between the people who don't believe in dinosaurs and Richard Dawkins there are interventionists. Those who know that the world probably isn't in God's hands, but it also probably isn't a meaningless void.</p>

<p>I can fuck with this abstraction.</p>

<p>I'm against thinking that these abstractions are real. I want to drop out of the race for power. Blow up the exponential curve. Because its just an idea we invented. Studying ourselves. Is the stupidest thing. I don't want to settle into some benign role on the spectrum, and I don't want to rule the world. A healthy but not megalomaniacal appetite. It's functionally incompatible.  Our realities. (I don't believe in God or god.)</p>

<p>It's existential!</p>

<p>Something sweet and funny about wanting to validate ones existence. Why am I doing this? I want to connect with people. I want to advance ideas.</p>

<p>If there is a primal instinct I'm a poor genetic specimen. So far I have not managed to reproduce. I would apologize but to whom?</p>

<p>Somehow I have landed in a nunnery. Dedicated the the advancement of science and art. There should just be a fucking school, where people go to learn multiplication in the reproductive sense.</p>

<p>We are the scum of the earth. The thought leaders. There is some debauchery, but in comparison this is a place of rigor. Home of chaste workers.</p>

<p>What's disturbing is that the educated go out and control the world. I met a consultant who has broken trust down to a science, which she sells to corporations. Trust, she says, is good for business. And what about business? What's that good for? I asked her. She smiled smart-but-dead-like and said, you have to believe that growing the economy is good for the world. Consulting is a desired job — maybe the quintessential job — of the educated class.</p>

<p>The world, as seen by consultants, is represented by metaphors or graphs. Broken down into her science or spun into his story. And then we ask, how can we make tomorrow better for <em>our children</em>! I'm inclined to say that genetic information doesn't give a fuck about the human race. It has no fucks to give. But if we allocate our resources: food, violence, sex, ideas, ego, entertainment, correctly we may be able to stall the implosion of the human species.</p>

<p>I have to ask if smarter DNA is better DNA. Perhaps the meta cognizant come more tightly coiled. If I am wrong, then I surrender. I want to know the most efficient expression. I want to know the end but I don't think this has one because it's not a story with a plot, it's a system. A line with an arrow indicating up up up up up up up...</p>

<p>Thes a sick quantification in all of this. I want to question the quality of the information on which systemic decisions are based. In <em>Points at Which to Intervene in a System</em> Donella Meadows describes a spectrum. From adjusting the levers of a faucet to showing the pipe</p>

<p>The first time Kevin diagrammed a system on the board: inputs, outputs, I was blown away. But what started to sicken me is that this isn't some game. This is how people in charge make choices?!</p>

<p>After I took a class on color theory I could never do my laundry the same way again. Stacking shirts became an exercise of hue and value relationships.</p>

<p>In my systems class I received a D for not turning in work (this protest is part of making amends before the grade adjustment period is over) but I couldn't bring myself to make a move all semester. I was struck by paralysis, which I’m just now coming to terms with. A heightened experience of color is cool but a heightened experience of systems is TERRIFYING.</p>

<p>There are different ways to depict a system, for example, Pirates in Somalia. One is long-form journalism that runs through the economic reasoning tied in with narrative. Another emerging form is something called a newsgame. It doesn't tell the story or even necessarily explain itself, but leaves the player with a simulated first-hand understanding of the dynamics of Somali piracy: input, output, risk, strategy, conditions of chance, loops. A kind of understanding that transcends content.</p>

<hr />

<p>What follows is my TOTALLY FICTIONAL (was scared to put this on dropbox for a minute while I was writing in case they are scanning for crazies) future Zuckerberg assassination. It's embarrasing stuff, at this point.</p>

<p>1.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, was assasinated on Tuesday near his home in Palo Alto. He was out walking his dog, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beast.the.dog">Beast</a>, when he was hit with a single bullet. Neighbors, who heard the shot, alerted the police. He will be succeeded at the company by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.</p>

<p>2.</p>

<p><strong>Anchor 1:</strong></p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of the ubiquitous social networking website Facebook, was found dead last Tuesday at his home in Palo Alto. While the exact nature of the death has yet to be disclosed, the county coroner has ruled it a suicide. This news comes shortly on the eve of Facebook's multi-billion dollar IPO, entering the company into public trading, and making Zuckerburg one of the world's richest <em>and</em> most powerful political figures. Political Figure isn't the job title you expect to hear for a college dropout who founded a social network, but Facebook's political presence became undeniable.</p>

<p>The capital was relocated to Palo Alto, with additional political offices at the company's data center in Prineville, Oregon.</p>

<p>Shortly after their Initial Public Offering in 2012, Facebook updated <em>politics</em>. In early forms of theocratic government, belief in God's word was used by political leaders for undisputed control. Secular-ish democracy enforced order with trust in the government and punishment by the justice system. Government 3.0 is more insidious because it exists inside your head.</p>

<p>In his 2012 State of the Union address, President Obama spoke of “cyber threats.” He was likely referring to hacking from China or terrorism in the form of disabling network infrastructure so critical to the functioning of today's world, but little did he know that the hearts and minds of American citizens (and others around the globe — though less so) were already enlisted in a nation called Facebook.</p>

<p>Activism was replaced by Liketivism. Or as some old-timers in the transition period disparagingly referred to it, “Slacktivism.” (These comments were hidden from Top News via an upgrade to the Edge-Rank algorithm in late 2012.)</p>

<p>Cities were replaced by information-space, which in the latest Facebook release, argued Zuckerberg, finally enabled communication which surpassed physical f2f (face-to-face) interaction. Those who were born “before” seemed to remember something else, though it was a vague feeling and no tagged photos, posts, or pages for this idea could be located. Historians looking at the state's formation criticized Zuckerberg's valiant statements about improving communication, waving disintegrating paper documents — olde inkjet printouts of a conversation scraped off of the Internet (as they used to call it) where Zuckerberg calls the site's first users quote “suckers” end quote. A testimony from someone who was ostensibly in the dorm room at Old Harvard in the early days (who can know if it's true) claimed that Facebook was first invented to compare women. Yet technological innovation has consistently trickled from the porn industry or the military — and by extension technological means for sex or violence. What was only beginning to be predicted was technology's close pairing with control. Zuckerberg's role at the center of all this was, perhaps, foreshadowed by investor Warren Buffet, who came closest to Facebook's present scope of info-power in the naughts (00-09) when he was widely known to have better, more realtime information than the government itself, thanks to stakes at leading corporations in nearly every industry. His genius, it was seen, was connecting otherwise privileged data from trains, planes, and ships with otherwise privileged data from energy companies, with otherwise privileged data from the financial sector into some throbbing graph of unprecedented accuracy, timeliness, and fidelity. The map of the world that came closest (in its time) to approaching the size of the world itself, yet fit in the palm of a hand. It was Zuckerberg who applied this same panoptic form of infopower to everyday life, and therefore citizenry. Users became subjects. A social network became the first social government.</p>

<p>And then there's this, sort of riffing on the sketch of alternative interfaces and channeling the heavy-handed internet-y aesthetic:</p>

<p>Like I said, EMBARRASING STUFF. Like, seriously just bad. But at least fast moving, at this point.</p>

<p>Wednesday all my classes were cancelled and I had stayed up late, so I did a little bit of work on the freelance project in the morning and then basically read the internet for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5884684/why-ill-never-trust-a-human-with-my-data-again">LOTS OF ROBOTS</a>:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;Look, I love small businesses. And I prefer to do business with them. But the sad fact is that when it comes to data, your information is likely more secure in the hands of a giant MegaCorp than with an individual. Because, after all, what happens if that individual goes away? Who will protect your data? The internet is simply a way to connect people. But what happens when a person, who forms a vital link in that chain, disconnects? Im about to find out. Im hoping my host will pop back up. That hes simply going to pay to renew his registration, and that all of this will go away. But in the meantime, Im backing up all my data and shopping for a new host. One with a staff. And robots. Lots of robots. Because human beings tend to fail.</p>

<p>Walked to school and home again over the bridge. Is it possible to be addicted to a bridge?? Also, there is a Momofuku Milk Bar between home and school, at which I get cookies. That might be part of it. But the bridge is even better than nature, I think. Reminds me of why living in a city is so badass. Some days I listen to Philip Glass and other days I listen to Britney Spears, both excellent choices of bridge music.</p>

<p>Milled around, scanned notes, and strung links together for this weeknote for a few hours. Got drinks with Aaron and Alex and <em>then</em> went to sculpture. Testing <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/02/why-being-sleepy-and-drunk-are-great-for-creativity/">this theory</a> although I consider Jonah Lehrer a hack. Sculpture class has been consistently bad this semester with a lack of work — especially work that requires or demands conversation, but Niki is hilarious so it's just disappointing not painful. Had a great studio visit with her after where we talked about almost everything I'm working on and mad about and scared about and she joked that the workmakeswork show is "like santa's factory" (which kind of says it all), and I went home confused and excited about making things. Tempted to walk the bridge but took the subway.</p>

            <p>Had lots of fun this week(!) but it was lousy work-wise. A getting-sick mixed with spring-fever-y lull to last week's mania.</p>

<p>Thursday I was tired and in a weird mood from staying up all night. Didn't really manage to read Kant or Hegel so that was a painful Western Theories of Art class discussion. Sculpture was okay, flapped my gums without saying anything smart about the work.</p>

<p>Audrey linked me to this great essay by <a href="https://www.readability.com/articles/vzosabhm">Joe Scanlan on social space and relational aesthetics</a>.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Relational aesthetics set out to tap the creative potential of social space. But now--more than ever--social space is responsible for suppressing most of what is worthwhile about making art in the first place: Narcissism. Solipsism. Delusion. Perversion. Dedication. Fantasy. Absurdity. And while relational aesthetics might have changed the kinds of conversations we have about art, to include questions such as what an artwork might be made of, who could be involved, or where it might begin and end, rarely have these ideas been acute enough in practice to overcome common decency. And that's a shame. Because if there's one thing we need less of in the United States right now, it's common decency--or at least Bill Frist's idea of common decency. These days, both politically and aesthetically, I prefer to adhere to Martin Kippenberger's creed: "Keiner hilft keinem." Every man for himself. For better and worse, Kippy's iconoclasm affords a greater range of expression than tacit collaboration ever could. What's more, it just feels better. For all relational aesthetics' claims to utopia and tomorrow being another fine day, an aesthetic that can't allow anything bad to happen sounds more like anesthesia to me.</p>

<p>But I sort of lost steam on whatever I was mad about last week regarding social practice and <a href="http://www.workmakeswork.org">that-kaila-show</a>.</p>

<p>Friday went to Chelsea for the first time in maybe a year. Aaron picked up a <a href="http://pwrpaper.com/">Pwr Paper</a> at Printed Matter then we went to wait in line for <a href="http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibition/doug-wheeler/">Doug Wheeler</a>. Spent maybe 45 minutes waiting outside the gallery. It was cold. Aaron had to leave for class before we even got in (ha), but I sat there and sat there and sat there. The two sort of old ladies in front of me were funny because one was really calm and the other one kept saying things like, "if I wanted to see a blank room I could just go into my bathroom!" After getting inside there was another hour of waiting but I finished The Handmaid's Tale, which I had to read for school that weekend anyway. The waiting room scene was as much of a spectacle as the thing itself. A group of school kids who waited more patiently than I would've been able to at that age. Listening to the gallerina repeat instructions to everyone. She asked the kids not to run up the curved wall. Some of the kids came out like OMG and others were like WASTE OF TIME. I stayed in for just over a full cycle, taking my glasses off and putting them on, walking around and standing still, noticing dust or flaws in the paint and spacing out, trying to remember if my eyes were open or closed. It was pretty similar to seeing this <a href="http://www.olafureliasson.net/works/360_room_for_all_colours.html">Olafur piece at SF MOMA</a> a few years ago. The weirdest part was that I couldn't stop thinking about how much I wanted to clip my eyelashes. They were causing vignetting!</p>

<p>Walked back to school and then met Niki in Chinatown for porkbuns, bubble tea, and Xi'an, but I was too exhausted (maybe from having my eyes/brain blasted with light) and made for bad company. Went to a fun party later.</p>

<p>Saturday did nothing but take a walk and make the best ravioli ever, which we bought from some ludicrously authentic smoky garage.</p>

<p>Saw a wheelchair dog!</p>

<p>Saw the Rite Aid in Greenpoint that used to be some kind of roller disco and still has a disco ball! (Highly recommended.)</p>

<p>Sunday did the superbowl thing and that was fun. Not sure why the ads were so bad this year or how they turned the entire field into a screen in 10 minutes but it looked awesome. Especially when they dropped Madonna in a hole and flashed this message out of nowhere:</p>

<p>Sunday was also my one year anniversary of following myself-a-year-ago on various social networks (weird!) thanks to <a href="http://www.twitshift.com/">twitshift</a> and more recently <a href="http://timehop.com/">timehop</a>. It's always crazy seeing what was going on a year ago. And I love rediscovering old gems like this:</p>

<p>Monday I bought a giant pad of newsprint and screwed it into the wall of my studio, but have yet to write on it. Sort of like buying a too-nice notebook. Filed under: failed motivational techniques. Rejiggered the Girl Walk <a href="http://girlwalkallday.com/events">events page</a> for them before they head out to the west coast. Still some work to do on that site. Had a good burrito.</p>

<p>Tuesday had five minutes of photo because Christine was doing studio visits for the next two days. Censorship was good, although I felt the pain of having to repeat a lower-level class when sitting through a lesson on how to use academic databases and cite your sources. Sort of blacked out on my desk and the librarian lecturing us publicly shamed me. Cool. Went home feeling sick, took NyQuil, fell asleep.</p>

<p>The highlight of a rather slooow and braindead week was a studio visit with Christine on Wednesday. She showed up with readings and questions based on the introduce-yourselves-survey we had taken on the first day. It's exciting to take such a structure-less class where the teacher's only agenda is to help you move your work forward. Words I scribbled down in my notebook: whimsy, (dark) humor, telling a joke until it's no longer funny, people who hang on to youth culture until they're 70, discomfort, photo archive, if I went blind, the problem is the content.</p>

<p>Other than that spent all of Wednesday doing my Publication Design homework that I didn't get around to doing. Mad at myself for waiting until the day it was due to start. That shouldn't happen. That class makes me feel REALLY BAD at design, in a good way. It feels a lot like having a graphic design job (which is annoying) but I can tell I'm getting better faster than I was at work. He's a great teacher.</p>

<p>We had to read + respond to Jeff Keedy's <em>The Rules of Typography According to <strike>Crackpots</strike> Experts</em> in which he quotes Beatrice Warde's famous crystal goblet:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine. For if you have no feelings about wine one way or the other, you will want the sensation of drinking the stuff out of a vessel that may have cost thousands of pounds; but if you are a member of that vanishing tribe, the amateurs of fine vintages, you will choose the crystal, because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than to hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain... Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a “modernist” in the sense in which I am going to use the term. That is, the first thing he asked of this particular object was not “How should it look?” but “What must it do?” and to that extent all good typography is modernist.</p>

<p>But then Keedy is all like, "Beatrice Warde did not imagine her crystal goblet would contain PEPSI-COLA, but some vessel has to do it." It's a liberating read, sticking it to stodgy old typographers. His golden rule is: pay attention. (The opposite of following or reacting to rules.) For the illustration portion of my response I photographed this horrendously cheesy goblet of alphabet soup.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz5nyms7u21qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I have a hard time getting excited and feeling good about graphic design. I pretty much always want to be like I DIDN'T MAKE THAT. There's a better way, which I need to figure out, that's not just getting it done.</p>

<p>This morning I gave a nervous little presentation on Riegel's history of ornament and we talked about that and Wolflinn. It was better than last week but by the end I was still writhing in my seat with spring fever!!!! Went outside for a long time and stretched and climbed on the building like a maniac until a security guard came outside and was like STOP. It was really fun. Sculpture was just-okay. Had a funny conversation about a boring piece. Tried to remember other times where we had good conversations about bad work, it's possible but today sucked.</p>

<p>If I had my way I would just play outside all day. Christine joked that people think of art school as this place where people are drugged out and painting with tempera but it's really rigorous and hard. Tons of self-motivation required. Spartan work ethics! Which most of the time is hard to pull off. I have a bunch of Writer windows open on my computer of things that need to get written, sent, done. Hoping for a few quiet, productive days. And not getting sicker. Going to manage my huge amounts of time better and stop waiting for the mood to strike to do work. In conclusion: ice cream, NyQuil, goodnight.</p>

            <p>(a.k.a. week-and-almost-a-half note)</p>

<p>Basically too tired to write this, want to keep putting it off, but the longer I wait the harder it gets to remember what I even did all day on those glorious fridays and mondays off. It wasn't nothing.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lynhlo3AeR1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Tuesday had our first class for photo. Christine is great. We talked for a while and she gave us some readings and a pep-talk about failure. (Everyone wants to give us that, Niki's was about how Cooper students aren't lazy, like some people — <em>cough</em> visiting artists <em>cough</em> — think, but that there's this intense anxiety about what to do next. I will accept all pep-talks. They help.)</p>

<p>Then Global Censorship, which is a lower-level class I have to take because I failed my Beckett class for not turning in essays. (Beckett would be proud?) Anyway the Beckett class sucked and Censorship turns out to be the class I wanted all along! It's fascinating to think about, especially in the hyper-expanded definition of censorship that we're working with. Some examples that came to mind were Julian Assange's ideas for using <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-julian-assange-part-i/">cryptographic hashes</a> to combat internet censorship, how censorship is built into products and toys (like life-like dolls for children that are <a href="https://gist.github.com/67c7aeeb5b85c0fa3d56">programmed to shut off rather than cry</a>, when they are being hit or turned upside down), how the best way to communicate to people 100,000 years in the future not to dig up our <a href="http://www.intoeternitythemovie.com/">nuclear waste</a> might not be to educate them but to erase its very existence from cultural memory, the relationship between censorship (in the sense of content) and <a href="http://vsdesign.org/publications/pdf/64_friedman.pdf">bias in computer systems</a>. Excited to explore all this more. Have been eye-ing <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/getinvolved/internships">Berkman summer internships</a> for Internet research.</p>

<p>Wednesday had art issues and publication design. Art issues was bad, we talked about signs, signifiers, and other bullshit that no one cares about and may actually bear no relation to art. Publication design is dry but good, luckily Warren is hilarious. Design classes feel like a struggle to believe in graphic design and keep myself interested. I have so much to learn but the sharpening that happens in design classes feels so disconnected from everything else. And the work gives me office flashbacks. Don't even feel like writing about it here.</p>

<p>Thursday had art history and sculpture. Skimmed Plato, Aristotle, and Kant.</p>

<p>I need to get used to reading old things and dry things, not just stoopid blog posts. While I was reading Kant I couldn't help pausing to tweet a pic:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrdtnJJJK1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>LUCKY!

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript"></script>

<p>But I actually want to read all of it more closely after our class discussion. Weinstein is a great teacher.</p>

<p>In sculpture Aaron was the only one who showed. It was this and one other thing:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28629608@N08/6784650263/in/photostream/"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrbc7wbBG1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>People said it looked like it was made for the internet, and here it is on Flickr a few days later with likes and comments. I'm scared for the world after school because we can spend an hour picking something apart and the same thing goes down so smoothly on the internet. We need to do better.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyre3ck8Md1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started to write a response to <a href="http://dinca.org/likes-and-notes-at-a-glance-consumption-without-contextualizatio/9180.htm">Louis's essay on Likes</a> a while ago that really boils down to this: mythical future interfaces, better tools for which you (and I) can "offer no concretized" vision, will not solve uncriticality and info-consumerism online. Aaron, the day before, said something like, "nobody switches to less addictive tools, you have to destroy what's out there."</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/technology/riding-personal-data-facebook-is-going-public.html?pagewanted=all">Facebook IPO</a>, Alex Galloway wrote (on Facebook!!):</p>

<p>"The basic question: Is Facebook more like a newspaper or more like a factory? The liberal answer: it's a newspaper in that it gathers stories about people and circulates those stories back to its readers while leveraging reader attention for advertising dollars. Profit flows in from advertisers and the value of the company is determined by the marketplace. The progressive answer: it's a factory in that it demands unpaid micro labor from its users, extracting surplus value from such labor. Profit flows from commons-based peer production and thus value is ultimately produced by users (making the ads merely the "last mile" of valorization). NYT claims the former, obviously. But it's very important that we understand FB as a factory, not just another form of mass media."</p>

<p>On Friday I went home for the weekend, pushed pixels around trying to actually act on my complaint to Louis about how annoying I find the <a href="http://pooool.info/">pool</a> website. Launching something improved still feels far off, and made of a lot of small tweaks re: annoyances, but I had fun playing with CSS transforms. Doodling in HTML.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrctlodWI1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Saturday and Sunday I read half of <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> by Margaret Atwood, for Censorship. Experimented with <a href="http://readmill.com/CaseyG/reads/the-handmaids-tale">tracking my reading</a> of a printed book with this <a href="http://readmoreapp.com/">fancy little app</a> and Readmill, which gave me funny little estimates about how many more time's I'd need to sit down and read to finish the book. Cumbersome and novel. I like new stuff. Dystopian books fuck with my emotions because I A) start to confuse books with reality, always (did that happen in the book or IRL!?) and B) just kind of get sad and contemplative if that's what the characters are up to. Fixed that by playing Kirby with Niki for a little!</p>

<p>Returned to Brooklyn on Sunday night and made smores at a bonfire! In Brooklyn! Backyard fires in the city always feel illegal. Somebody threw in an old lacquered chair and other random crap from the backyard and the fire basically exploded.</p>

<p>Monday (maybe getting the order wrong here) watched a few bits from this talk at DLD on post-internet art, and Aaron and I got talking REALLY INTENSELY:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="254" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lt75A8vZwdI?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>This youtube comment makes me embarrassed to think about it. Good job, troll.
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrf3o6yDS1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Karen seemed really nervous giving her introduction (but, jesus, I would be too). I wonder if I will ever be able to speak in front of people without losing my shit.</p>

<p>Haven't watched it all, but it was pretty exciting when Daniel Keller went on (at 37 minutes in) and reminded everyone that animated gifs run on burnt coal and computers are built by slaves! Read this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html?pagewanted=all">article about Apple</a> and outsourcing of manufacturing. Maybe silly but I made <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=131040&#38;amp;d=1219301308">this</a> my phone background after hearing about somebody who received their phone with pictures from the factory left on it. Insane reminder that humans put these things together halfway across the world, also just a great photo.</p>

<p>Looked at a little of Daniel Keller/Aids-3D's work after the talk:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aids-3d.com/jpegs.html"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrf5qMQmH1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>&#38;gt;Berserker</p>

<p>&#38;gt;Styrofoam, acrylic, USB memory stick with 3D file</p>

<p>&#38;gt;A Von Neumann probe arrives on an alien world from earth with a single message —Reproduce me. It appears to be some sort of idol. It's image is its form, Its word is its flesh, its seed is information on a solid-state universal serial bus memory stick, It's essence encoded in binary. Is it an emissary of peace or a mindless virus programmed to dominate its surroundings?</p>

<p>It reminded me of <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/">Talk to Me</a> / my systems class with Kevin / design-y art crossover shit (but A3D is way more on the art side, aesthetically...it just <em>looks</em> like art) / social practice.</p>

<p>There isn't a hard line between (for lack of a better term) a "traditional studio practice" — visual artists thinking primarily about things like composition and pushing around forms in space (which seems like the way Aaron was working on that wheatpasted piece of furniture) and all of the above. The offshoots or bastard children of research-based conceptual art, advertising, product design aren't just noodling with materials, they're intent on communicating something. There's something exciting and essential! about this, how these people are dealing directly with the world: e.g. reality check on you people who are obsessed with immateriality because it's abstract and these things are very real and vast and powerful and (in my opinion) totally fucking terrifying! (sublime?! lol).</p>

<p><em>commercial break</em>, this again:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrf3o6yDS1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>:(</p>

<p>BUT there's something that is deeply unsatisfying about this kind of work. It's too clever. It's a good illustration for some essay but doesn't open up. Leaves me cold. I feel like I have almost no relationship with making the noodly material work but can't articulate why I hate the clever stuff so much. (Talk to Me left me DEPRESSED.) You could talk about the A3D alien the way we talk about sculptures built in the shop, but it almost seems to be asking to backburner that discussion. After all, there is a coal burning slave factory churning out iPads somewhere. A world to attend to! This is product design not sculpture.</p>

<p>Started to collect drafts, thoughts, and ideas to flesh out: forgetting.info, a Field Guide to Skeueomorphism (if only for myself, to collate my obsessive collection), post-internet antagonism (why won't people be <strike>mean to</strike> "CRITICAL of" eachother online (hai claire bishop), something about robot teachers, something about that crazy discussion I can't even fully recollect about capitalism and computing old art and new art. Github, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cdixon/statuses/157627012859695104">most important startup of 2011</a>, examples of it used for things besides coding.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago Kaila sent around a ridiculously open yet specific call for ~collaborations~ that quickly morphed into an "experimental" social practicey event thing with a student run coffee bar, radio station, newspaper published form within, chalkboards, someone planning to camp out, etc and so on ad infinitum.</p>

<p>I'm a jerk so I replied-all:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr9v8IY691qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But a week later stayed up all night / woke up in a fever about the show. Those things all seem to parody themselves. I started to sketch out an identical exhibition (in form) that is somehow a joke, even borrowing the same coffee stand (if possible!). Sketchup is fun, it's kind of like shopping.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr9y8Xje51qzrmn8.png" alt="" />

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr9z7ixAf1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It's not done but you can <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6443454/artshow.skp">download the show</a> here. Their proposed title is WORK MAKES WORK, a sort of collaborative studio space, but the word on the tip of my tongue is IDEA ECONOMY. A sort of retro (peaked in 1995?) term calling into play both this bullshit: "The primary product of the Idea Economy is ideas. You and I can and must produce ideas just as those who prospered in previous economies had to produce crops, manufactured goods, and most recently, services." but also the tone of economy, as in economical (cut-rate), efficient (factory!) is kind of a sad undertone. A collaborative workspace/group under the pretense of an exhibition is encumbered! Precious!</p>

<p>Photo, on Tuesday, was great. We talked about a reading on ruins that reminded me of these [<a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2011/aug/17/its-only-humanist/">1</a>, <a href="http://greeknewmediashit.tumblr.com/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.demarconia.com/grindingonthegreeks.html">3</a>]. Everybody showed old things and talked about where they're coming from / at / going. Starting with my psychotic breakdown last time I took a photo class:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrbwpNXRy1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dawit wasn't interested in ideas. Only pretty projects. And I was thinking big and scary.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrbn6JyqE1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then decided to go after sensitive photographers, many of whom are friends. It wasn't the things in books that angered me, it was the people around me.</p>

<p><a href="http://sensitivephotogeneration.com"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrbodxF2C1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Took the <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/2010/sexy-studio-self-portraits/">sexy studio</a> art portraits, resulting in a D and an admonishment to be compassionate, constructive, and ethical:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrbyjN1qU1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Decent advice but that group needed to be shaken up much more than I was able to.</p>

<p>Told a story about the two sides of my family. On my dad's side and back a few generations they were prolific recreational photographers. I found a box of beautiful glass negatives at granny &#38;amp; grandpas.</p>

<p>Family (dad's side) with guns:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr9gxqS1H1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One night at dinner my mom was telling me about her grandmother with long silver hair and bright blue eyes. I said I had never seen a picture of her. That's because, I learned, she considered photography to be a SIN. A SIN! So she was never photographed. I was overjoyed when I heard that. It made sense in some weird hereditary-we-take-issue-with-this way. ME. TOO. GRANNY.</p>

<p>Photograph of my great grandma (mom's side):
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyrc25ob851qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Anyway, the stories are fun, but most people are more interesting than their work, said Christine. The goal, I think, this time around — going forward — is to do something with all these problems that isn't so much of a direct reaction or disparaging to a certain group. Even if I'm saying the same thing essentially, Dawit's little trio of advice still makes me wrinkle my nose because it's about being nice in all the wrong (fake!) ways.</p>

<p>Wednesday I had a conversation with Troy pegging the current internet-y aesthetic to <a href="http://www.werkplaatstypografie.org">dutch typography</a>.</p>

<p>I sat through half of my Contemporary Art Issues class, grumbling and glaring at people for all the bullshit that was being spouted. It seems like not even the teacher (a nice guy!) wants to talk about art in these shitty, shitty LOVELESS words.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr9r09Muq1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>When I was a freshman I had another run-in with Rosalind Krauss. When I told Martha I was no longer going to make things, she made me look at the expanded field diagram and attend a lecture-y symposium thing at The New School with her on UN-UN-sculpture vs. NOT-NOT-sculpture. Both of us were skin-crawling-ly ready to get the hell out of that room after about 10 minutes, after which I promised her I would never think again.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr9l6k05R1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There's something interesting but MEH about it all, theory. During break from Art Issues, in a Rosalind-Krauss-induced stabby panic I sprinted across the street to the office and dropped the class. It even cost $25 to drop (since the ARBITRARY free period ended on Monday) but it is well worth it to not sit through that. I ran back in, grabbed my bag, and walked straight out of the room. I was all like:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyr8ygtUCM1qzrmn8.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Except totally silent. I sat in the sunshine(!) had a conversation with Kaila about the show and why I hate it, and finished my design homework. Pub design was excellent.</p>

<p>I am grateful for a schedule that allows for me to totally mess up my sleeping patterns (or lack thereof) for a few late night and early nights. This week: still thinking about those systems projects (keep not doing that) but made headway on explaining what I don't like, publication design homework (I have a lot to learn), freelance design work dealings, thinking about a cover letter for the Berkman internship (though I might have to stay in New York and do summer classes as a consequence for dropping art issues, ha), reading hegel by 10am, thinking about kailas show and my own (sculpture?), lots of reading, and fleshing out some of those draft ideas mentioned above to keep myself writing.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this weird song by Laurie Anderson that I want to hate but looove where she raps about bailouts and Oprah.</p>

            <p>I've always wanted to keep weeknotes like <a href="berglondon.com/blog/tag/weeknotes/">Berg London</a>. <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7189">Snarkmarket</a> once posted about why they're so great. I guess I am late to writing this, my first weeknote, not just because it's the 4th week of the year, but it's also a Monday, not a Friday. However my schedule is a little kooky this semester: Mondays and Fridays off(!!!) so I'm disoriented about what constitutes a "week" or the end of one.</p>

<p>Monday was MLK day, so we had no school. Aaron and I came across two apartments in the same glass building projecting blond ladies on their wall:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9ovaYNb41qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And watched a talk by Lawrence Lessig:</p>

<p>Tuesday was rescheduled to have Monday classes for some reason so I was off again. Went to school and felt butterflies and excitement. Ate at Japadog (finally open on St. Marks!) which was a lifechanging experience. Later we bought mousetraps for our house mouse. There were a few different brands at the dollar store, each with their own morose cartoon of a crying mouse.</p>

<p>On second thought, buying the cheapest traps (4 for $1!) might've been a stupid idea because no mouse has been stupid enough to step into them yet and I failed to think about what happens after the mouse gets stuck. Kelli informs me that you can just put some vegetable oil on the adhesive to release the poor thing...once you figure out how to take it outside. In all likelihood this will end up going down like the David Sedaris story where he drowns a rat in his bathtub with a spray bottle of Windex.</p>

<p>Wednesday I went to the SOPA/PIPA protest with Alex. My phone was dead which felt so wrong at an internet rally. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117114202722218150209/posts/4GgaRiSyaTf">Joel Spolsky</a> said it best:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;The internet seems to ignore legislation until somebody tries to take something away from us... then we carefully defend that one thing and never counter-attack. Then the other side says, "OK, compromise," and gets half of what they want. That's not the way to win... that's the way to see a steady and continuous erosion of rights online. The solution is to start lobbying for our own laws. It's time to go on the offensive if we want to preserve what we've got. Let's force the RIAA and MPAA to use up all their political clout just protecting what they have. Here are some ideas we should be pushing for: * Elimination of software patents * Legal fees paid by the loser in patent cases; non-practicing entities must post bond before they can file fishing expedition lawsuits * Roll back length of copyright protection to the minimum necessary "to promote the useful arts." Maybe 10 years? * Create a legal doctrine that merely linking is protected free speech * And ponies. We want ponies. We don't have to get all this stuff. We merely have to tie them up fighting it, and re-center the "compromise" position.</p>

<p>My art issues class was cancelled because the teacher was unexpectedly out of the country(?). It wasn't so bad because we all hung out for an hour and ate free cake that was auspiciously available in the building. The class was supposed to be taught by Litia Perta, of <a href="http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/12/local/why-cooper-union-matters">Why Cooper Matters</a> fame, but she (understandably) backed out after this administrative bullshit happened:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;I was hired to teach at Cooper in 2006 when I was a doctoral candidate and my semester’s fee for 14 weeks was $4,500. Sometime later, after completing my Ph.D. and spending a year as a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for the Humanities at Wesleyan University, I returned to Cooper Union. It was the fall of 2009 and I was re-hired by the college’s dean of the humanities at the exact same rate I was paid in 2006. I was told at the time that the budget could not accommodate any fee increase for having received my Ph.D., nor could it afford paying any increase for the standard annual rates of inflation. That same year, the dean who hired me received a compensation package valued at $239,724.</p>

<p>Instead I sat in on a performance class with Emily Roysdon which was fun. We listed all sorts of words that relate to performance: presence, time, etc...I said that I like how HOKEY performance is but it didn't even make the board. Hokey is in fact a real word, according to the OED:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9pvmZa0K1qzrmn8.png" alt="" />

<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9q7dW73M1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And not only is it a word, it is the PERFECT WORD. This reading was given to us from Peformance: a critical introduction by Marvin Carlson:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9qepuNuq1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As it turns out, I can't even be in this performance class anyway because it conflicts with art issues.</p>

<p>Wednesday night I had a short introduction to my Publication Design class, where I learned we would be dealing exclusively with print. Working on assignments based on designing coffee table books and commercial magazines feels like barking up a dying tree, but the class is supposed to be amazing and I know there's a lot of skills to be developed in working with printed matter that aren't necessarily locked in to the collapse of that industry.</p>

<p>Thursday had an excellent art history class, which will actually be about Western <em>Theories</em> of Art. Meta! Sculpture in the evening with Niki was great as always.</p>

<p>Friday was a makeup class for art issues, which was alright. Too much theory makes Jack a dull boy.</p>

<p>On Saturday I was served this suspiciously well-targeted ad while watching a Beyonce video...</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9opk2AUA1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>...and read this <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/01/matthew-battles-it-doesnt-take-cupertino-to-make-textbooks-interactive/?fromfloater">amazing article by Matthew Battles</a> on the fallacy of Apple's iPad textbooks actually reinventing education.</p>

<p>&#38;gt; As Schiller ticked down the list, for feature after feature — portability, durability, interactivity, searchability, and currency — the book earned a big red X.</p>

<p>but!</p>

<p>&#38;gt;Interactivity doesn’t exist. More properly, everything is interactive. We use the catch-all term “interactivity” to brand as novel the qualities exhibited by digital objects striving to be like real-world objects. But chairs, raindrops, sandwiches, and envelopes are also interactive — in their own evolved ways. Books in fact exhibit rich interactive habits, evolved to engage us in peculiar ways (and increasingly, these very features are counted as bugs).</p>

<p>The whole <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/">Niemanlab</a> site is awesome, never really poked around there before, but their projects like <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/fuego/">Fuego</a> (a twitter link aggregator) and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/encyclo/">Encyclo</a> (a wiki for the future of journalism) are great resources.</p>

<p>Sunday was an amazing food day. Had lunch at The Meatball Shop and dinner at Daisy's BBQ, with coffee at Blue Bottle in between over which I met Louis Doulas IRL and we talked about redesigning <a href="http://pooool.info/">Pool</a>. Read a great article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/fashion/danah-boyd-cracking-teenagers-online-codes.html?_r=1&#38;amp;hp=&#38;amp;pagewanted=all">Danah Boyd</a> that makes me want to finish <a href="http://readmill.com/CaseyG/reads/alone-together-why-we-expect-more-from-technology-and-less-from-each-other">Sherry Turkle's <em>Alone Together</em> (a little over halfway through)</a>. I can't shake this one particular interview from my head of some teens who call adolescence "the years of profile writing." So freaky.</p>

<p>I watched a lot of weird robot videos this week. Incredibly creepy and kind of funny. They're getting so much better but also not at all.</p>

<p>I want to see this movie, <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/01/22/robot-and-frank-premiere/">Robot and Frank</a>:
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9rxd86CZ1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>From the director:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;I suppose it’s possible that some actors might have had trouble working against a robot, but to some degree all those ideas are built into the script. We purposefully designed the robot to be faceless, so that it could appear either creepy or cute, depending on what point we were at in the film. Any discomfort Frank might have felt could only help that early awkward part of their relationship. Getting the emotional connection that develops to feel honest is probably a lot harder, and something that very few other actors could pull off.</p>

<p>Can't wait until <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/i_have_seen_the_future_of_ui_and_it_is_gaze/?utm_campaign=shorturl">this</a> is a thing:</p>

<iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3MoGzTdQnX8" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>A good <a href="http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2012/01/the-artist-who-keeps-office-hours-at-her-show/">interview with Zoe Strauss</a>, who is keeping office hours at her show in Philadelphia. The people she photographs <a href="http://blogs.artinfo.com/modernartnotes/2012/01/zoe-strauss-is-a-good-start-pma-must-do-more/">can't afford to see her work</a>, though.</p>

<p>Despite all the good that comes out of it, I have a morbid obsession with failed Kickstarter projects and the limitations of the site's populism. Matt Haughey has a good writeup of <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2012/01/lessons-for-kickstarter-creators-from-the-worst-project-i-ever-funded-on-kickstarter.html">one such horror story</a>. Marco Arment, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/08/10/coffee-joulies-review">another</a>.</p>

<p>Best/worst article title of the week award goes to <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/critgame/wordpress/2011/11/the-rattomorphism-of-gamification/">The Rattomorphism of Gamification</a>. In plainspeak, gamification turns users into rats. Interesting psychological take on why gamification will eventually fail:</p>

<p>&#38;gt; the logic of gamification is the logic of corrosion...over the long run operant conditioning saps and undermines any intrinsic motivation a person has. It is this intrinsic motivation that gamification seeks to engage (or exploit) and which operant conditioning seems to activate in the short term, but this game apparently doesn’t end well....the design techniques that are appropriated by gamification will become objects of resentment given their omnipresence in the new media ecology. Game designers would be forced innovate, rejecting the rattomorphism they inadvertently inspired.</p>

<p>Brent Simmons wrote <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/12/23/gamification_sucks">a great thing on gamification</a> and <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2011/12/26/learning_from_games/">Lukas Mathis</a> reponds:</p>

<p>&#38;gt;There are many problems with «gamification», but I don’t think [manipulation] is one of them. Essentially, all UI design is about manipulating users, whether you’re coming up with the most easily understood button labels that will get people to click on the correct button, the most readable typeface that will get people to read your essay, or design ideas taken from videogames. The goal of UI design is to get people to use our products successfully. That’s «manipulating people». I suspect that «gamification» makes people uncomfortable because it’s associated with Skinner box type games like FarmVille and World of Warcraft, games that can be actively harmful to their players, and manipulate them into doing things that go against their own best interests. But the idea of taking design hints from games itself is value-neutral.</p>

<p>Enjoyed <a href="http://90wpm.com/post/15965430594/distance-excerpt">Ben Jackson's excerpt</a> from his upcoming essay of game ethics in <a href="http://distance.cc/">Distance</a>. And of course there's the great <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_cowclicker/all/1">Wired piece on Ian Bogost</a> and Cow Clicker. "It is very interesting, clicking nothing. We were clicking nothing the whole time. It just looked like cows.”</p>

<p>Three best things about MegaUpload (I didn't even know the site by name before it was taken down):</p>

<p>1 — KIM KARDASHIAN?</p>

<p>2 — <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/most-interesting-facts-about-kim-dotcom-the-found">Kim Dotcom's lifestyle</a>:
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly9t5hMm6i1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" />
"Kim Dotcom has a car with the license plate: "GUILTY". He also had a Rolls Royce with the license plate: “GOD". Other luxury cars have plates that say: "MAFIA," "EVIL," and "STONED.""</p>

<p>3 — The landing page that the U.S. district court replaced <a href="http://megaupload.com">MegaUpload.com</a> with:

<p>Finally, my first post for <a href="http://rhizome.org/">Rhizome</a> hit the internet today! So excited to be writing for them. <a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jan/23/book-review-programmed-visions-software-and-memory/">I reviewed Wendy Chun's mindboggling book <em>Programmed Visions: Software and Memory</em></a>.</p>

<p>On deck this week? Fixing bugs and moving things around on the <a href="http://girlwalkallday.com">Girl Walk</a> site before they hit the road for a massive <a href="http://girlwalkallday.tumblr.com/post/15969423817/were-very-excited-to-announce-a-west-coast-tour">west coast dance tour</a>. Thinking about systems (binary, genetics, the city) for some projects I failed to get done last semester and still have to turn in!! Readings lots of theory. Doing research for a coffee table book on the Hudson Valley. Thinking about sculptures. Mocking up ideas for Pool. Sending New Years cards that I letterpressed, wrote, and completely failed to send at the start of 2011.</p>

            <h2>Technical Notes</h2>

<p>The site was built on Wordpress and extended in key ways to support the project. Custom fields were added to accomodate structured metadata about interviewees, locations, discussion topics, and extra reading materials. While all of this information could be (and usually is) just typed into a big textbox, stratifying it out affords better organization. The combination of custom fields and custom taxonomies allows visitors to filter conversations by Location and Tag, ways of browsing that will become increasingly important as the amount of content on the site grows. Structured data also allows for fun touches like rendering each person's location as a little map, automagically.</p>

            <p>Alex, Aaron, and I made a site that puts YouTube videos on sweaters. But it might also be the next level / logical conclusion / death of the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sexy-sweaters">Sexy Sweaters meme</a> (which Alex is credited as originating(!) on Know Your Meme).</p>

<p>Wrangled APIs from YouTube, Clicky, Bitly to pull the whole site off with no database. And went a little cuckoo on the interface: it's completely chromeless until you hover, then a radial menu is triggered with links to the most popular sweaters in the past few days, a form field to generate your own, and a link to the psychotic <a href="http://sweatytube.com/activity">activity dashboard</a> (worth a look if you like seizure-inducing hovers).</p>

            <p><em>Written for and originally published at <a href="http://rhizome.org/editorial/2012/jan/23/book-review-programmed-visions-software-and-memory">Rhizome</a>.</em></p>

<p>After “getting fit” and whatever else people typically declare to be their new year’s resolutions, this year’s most popular goal is surprisingly nerdy: learning to code. Within the first week of 2012, over 250,000 people, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16440126"><span class="s1">including New York’s mayor Michael Bloomberg</span></a>, had signed up for weekly interactive programming lessons on a site called <a href="http://codeyear.com/"><span class="s1">Code Year</span></a>. The website promises to put its users “on the path to building great websites, games, and apps.” But as <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/01/code-year.html"><span class="s1">New Yorker web editor Blake Eskin</span></a> writes, “The Code Year campaign also taps into deeper feelings of inadequacy... If you can code, the implicit promise is that you will not be wiped out by the enormous waves of digital change sweeping through our economy and society.” </p>

<p class="p1">If the entrepreneurs behind Code Year (and the masses of users they’ve signed up for lessons) are all hoping to ride the wave of digital change, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, a professor of Modern Culture and Media at Brown University, is the academic trying to pause for a moment to take stock of the present situation and see where software is actually headed. All the frenzy about apps and “the cloud,” Chun argues, is just another turn in the “cycles of obsolescence and renewal” that define new media. The real change, which Chun lays out in her book <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262015424"><span class="s1"><em>Programmed Visions: Software and Memory</em></span></a>, is that “programmability,” the logic of computers, has come to reach beyond screens into both the systems of government and economics and the metaphors we use to make sense of the world.</p>

<p class="p1">“Without [computers, human and mechanical],” writes Chun, “there would be no government, no corporations, no schools, no global marketplace, or, at the very least, they would be difficult to operate...Computers, understood as networked software and hardware machines, are—or perhaps more precisely set the grounds for—neoliberal governmental technologies...not simply through the problems (population genetics, bioinformatics, nuclear weapons, state welfare, and climate) they make it possible to both pose and solve, but also through their very logos, their embodiment of logic.” </p>

<p class="p1">To illustrate this logic, Chun draws extensively on history, theory, and detailed technical explanations, enriching cursory understandings of software. “Understanding software as a thing,” she writes, “means engaging its odd materializations and visualizations closely and refusing to reduce software to codes and algorithms—readily readable objects—by grappling with its simultaneous ambiguity and specificity.” Indeed, Chun <span class="s2">spends a lot of time specifying computer terms. What's the difference between hardware, software, firmware, and wetware? Source code, compiled code, and written instructions? What is a <em>thing </em>and how did software become one? Even for a fairly nerdy computer user there’s a lot to pick up on. The book really shines, however, when Chun waxes poetic on the more ambiguous aspects of software. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The term “vaporware” refers to software that’s announced and advertised but never actually released for use, such as Ted Nelson’s infamous <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu.html"></a></span><span class="s1">Xanadu project</span>. Vaporware is problematic when it comes to theory because grand ideas and slick renderings rarely (if ever) align with the way technology looks and works in real life. Geert Lovink, Alexander Galloway, and others have called to banish “vapor theory,” theory built on hypothetical ideas about software rather than instantiations of it, which Lovink criticizes as, “gaseous flapping of the gums...generated with little exposure, much less involvement with those self-same technologies and artworks.” Chun concedes that while this embargo on vapor has been essential to grounding new media studies, “a rigorous engagement with software makes new media studies more, rather than less, vapory.” Vapor is not incidental to software, she argues, but actually essential to its understanding. This is what makes Chun’s theories exciting to follow: she engages renderings, dreams, and misunderstandings about technology rather than casting them aside. The key source of these misunderstandings is the use of the computer as metaphor.</p>

<p class="p1">People in previous generations conceptualized the world around them using technologies like clocks and steam engines. While these analog, mechanical devices are intricate, if one were to take apart a clock and and put it back together its inner workings could be understood. Digital computers are more complex because they are made of both tangible chips and immaterial codes, neither of which are intuitive to deconstruct. Further, all software interfaces, like the “paintbrush” tool in Photoshop, are metaphors themselves. “Who completely understands what one’s computer is actually doing at any given moment?” asks Chun, knowing that the answer is <em>nobody</em>. Yet this murky recursion of “unknowability” and vapors is exactly why Chun finds software to be such an apt metaphor for the world we live in. Recalling Stewart Brand’s call for a picture of the whole earth in 1968, Chun poses the question: what would a picture of the whole Internet look like? Except, in this case, to find out may not be the point. <span class="s2">In the way that the stock market is based on speculation—virally spreading fear about the future of a company (as opposed to concrete evidence or actual bad management decisions) can cause a stock to tank—a technologized world is increasingly based on conjecture.</span> In its unseeable, untouchable, and effectively unknowable nature, the computer represents the lens we need in order to think about the enormous and incomprehensible forces of social, economic, and political power that govern our lives. “[Software’s] ghostly interfaces embody—conceptually, metaphorically, virtually—a way to navigate our increasingly complex world,” writes Chun. </p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s3">The book looks at a broad range of examples from artists, scholars, and technologists to situate “programmability” in relation to everything from global systems like capitalist economics, neoliberal politics, and knowledge production to those of the mind and body: gender, race, and the structure of thought. The footnotes are full of interesting paths waiting to be followed: </span>Frederick P. Brooks on why programming is fun and hacking is addictive, Ben Shneiderman on direct manipulation interfaces, Brenda Laurel on computers as theatre and how that relates to skeuomorphism, and Thomas Y. Levin on the temporality of surveillance, to name just a few. While it’s tempting to look to this web of ideas and the history of computing as an <em>answer</em> for why things are the way they are today, Chun's point in invoking all these voices is that it’s not that clear cut.</p>

<p class="p1">Some of the book’s propositions about our relationship to computers seem overblown: a priestly source of power, a form of magic, code as a fetish. If nothing else, these phrases are provocative and point to how potent Chun finds software to be in the world today.<span class="s3"> </span><span>As more and more people find themselves able to create things out of code, it feels critical to understand software on both a practical and fundamental level.</span></p>

<h2>How we got where we are today</h2>

<p>Computers don’t know anything. They have to &#38;bull;be programmed and designed ex&#38;bull;tensively to make sense as tools for accomplishing even the most basic of tasks. If you wanted to draw a circle using an untrained computer, you’d have to tell the computer what a “circle” is, how to draw a line, and even that there’s something on which to draw. Today this is not the case. Tools for accomplishing most tasks have already been written, so you don’t have to know how to program in order to get things done. Photoshop, for example, makes drawing a circle into a single drag-and-drop action so intuitive that you never have to consider that there are complex procedures and equations going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>A computer connected to the internet becomes not just a tool for drawing circles, but a tool for communication and a magical container for all the forms of media that preceded it. The major websites on which artists have come to work and play: Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube, and Twitter, each do something a little different, but they are all free, mass-market, <a href="http://oreilly.com/lpt/a/6228">“Web 2.0”</a> tools, intended to connect users to each other through content they contribute: profiles, posts, videos, status updates. All types of people use these sites as entertainment and ways to keep up with friends and family, but for artists social networks also function as a casual and surprisingly robust publishing and distribution system, and are sometimes the subject of the work itself.</p>

<p>For the computer to become so widely used as a live, work and play space, it had to be modeled largely after the life which preceded it. On his <a href="http://122909a.com"><em>Post Internet</em> blog</a> Gene McHugh writes, “[the] ‘Internet’ became not a thing in the world to escape into, but rather the world one sought escape from…sigh…It became the place where business was conducted, and bills were paid. It became the place where people tracked you down.” Likewise, everyday life has become technologized to the extent that offline interactions now occur in the language of technology. A good conversation puts us “on the same wavelength,” as if we’re radios. The word “like” is becoming primarily a verb used to describe the action of “liking” a Facebook page.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget that Facebook didn’t exist until 2004, YouTube 2005, Twitter 2006, and Tumblr 2007. Networked technology is now present everywhere in everything from our always-on cellphones to connected urban infrastructures to autonomous global stock markets. Our lives have become so integrated with networks in such short order that it is almost unimportant to distinguish between communication on and offline. While my grandpa grins from ear-to-ear each time we video chat and talks about how we’re living in the future, my little sister routinely hangs out with her friends online, leaving the video chat window open in the background as a kind of presence. The perpetual connectedness of rising generations has kicked the computer’s status as spectacle into rapid decline.</p>

<p>John Durham Peters, who ponders “being on the same wavelength” in his book <em>Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication</em>, writes that, “communication as a person-to-person activity became thinkable only in the shadow of mediated communication.” He writes in the past tense with a certain sense of finality, as if this shift happened at a certain point in time and never changed. But new tools are being introduced every day, and with each system update or new website we sign up for the kinds of mediation we engage with change. It’s not so much that technology has crept into everyday life but that there is a back-and-forth exchange of metaphor between online and off; a continuous push and pull between fashioning our tools and being shaped by them.</p>

<h2>How our tools have changed</h2>

<p>In 1985, Marvin Minsky published <em>The Society of Mind</em>, a book that attempts to explain the possibility of artificial intelligence by atomizing complex human activities. For example, “making something out of blocks” is broken down into a tree of yes or no actions called “agents.” Minsky’s reductionism offers a remarkably clear description of how we interact with technology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you drive a car, you regard the steering wheel as an agency that you can use to change the car’s direction. You don’t care how it works. But when something goes wrong with the steering, and you want to understand what’s happening, it’s better to regard the steering wheel as just one agent in a larger agency: it turns a shaft that turns a gear to pull a rod that shifts the axle of a wheel. Of course, one doesn’t always want to take this microscopic view; if you kept all those details in mind while driving, you might crash because it took too long to figure out which way to turn the wheel. Knowing how is not the same as knowing why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Minsky’s distinction between having the ability to use a tool and understanding how it works is even more important today than it was in the 80’s because technology has become better, closer, and harder to distinguish, though it would appear that nothing has changed. One reason it’s easy to get confused is that designers attempt to hide when systems are technologized.</p>

<p>Several years ago when my mom’s car stalled on the highway, the repairman told her that the car was physically in fine shape but that its internal computer—an intermediary between the pedals and engine that serves as a sort of control center—had failed. A specialized code repairman had to be called in to run a diagnostic and figure out what went wrong.</p>

<p>When Minsky wrote about cars the underlying system was only hidden behind a facade of metal and plastic. The rods and gears between steering wheel and axle could be taken apart piece-by-piece and put back together in order to understand how the car works. Computers allow for an interface, like pedals or a steering wheel, to be decoupled from its mechanics. In a computerized car, changes to the steering wheel still result in a shifting of the axle but these actions are triggered by code, sensors, chips and wires (or even wireless signals). Try taking apart a microchip. Not only is it hard to reverse engineer without specialized knowledge but companies often intentionally block their users from accessing their proprietary code. If we’re not granted access to the obfuscated code loaded onto our cars’ computer chips, we can no longer really take our cars apart and put them back together again, and we have lost the potential to understand yet another one of the systems that govern our lives.</p>

<p>When we can’t deal with technology on its own terms: code, we rely on the metaphors presented by its interface to come up with a story about how it works. My mom didn’t even <em>know</em> her car had a computer in it until it broke down because it looked and worked just like every other vehicle she had ever owned. With a bit of cleverness, programmers and designers are able to make a computerized car appear no more complicated than a car from the 80’s though a computer is invisibly routing input from the steering wheel to the axles and optimizing for fuel efficiency. Because of this kind of hiding at both the interface and code levels, our attempts at understanding the tools we work with today more often result in amassing a series of built-up misunderstandings.
The car is an example of a relatable system that is secretly complex, but we also tend to project a sense of complexity onto simple systems. Paul Ford’s essay <a href="http://ftrain.com/times-inverted-index.html"><em>Time’s Inverted Index</em></a> illustrates the way we filter a computer’s indifferent output, like the results of a keyword search covering ten years of email, through our emotional brains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not the fault of the software, which is by definition unwitting. No one writing code said, “Let’s totally mess with his perception of self and understanding of free will.” The code sees an email that is filled with words as something like a small bucket that is filled with coins. It takes the coins out one by one and stacks them in squares marked out for each denomination, adding a slip of paper between each coin that indicates the coin’s bucket of origin. Then it does the same with the next bucket. There are many denominations of coins; a truly big table, called an inverted index, is needed to hold them all. The coin-sorting program cannot think or advise, but it does allow you to go to a pile of coins on the table, pick them up, and know their buckets of origin. It’s my unrigid brain that turns a sorted stack of coins into a story—so there I was, querying against my life, tapping the touchscreens of fate and clicking the mouse of destiny, all of it suffused with a sort of sweet nostalgia. (Of my emails, 893 mention libraries; 311 mention libraries and love.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting aside early experiments in <a href="">Information Retrieval</a>, there was really no such thing as “search,” as we know it, before web search was put into practical use in the 90’s5. Yet search has become a paradigm. A fundamental way we expect to access information. An inalienable right. I searched Google 46 times today alone. If we’re not looking critically at the way technology orders our experience, we’re operating on juxtapositions of information which may be arbitrary, unimportant, or—as is the case with the computerized car—beyond understanding. On top of this we interpret these results as bearing emotion, utility and truth.</p>

<p>Google is working hard to maintain the feeling of simplicity and effortlessness while simultaneously increasing the underlying complexity that makes results better. A <a href="">promotional site</a> boasts, “at any given time there are 50-200 different versions of our core algorithm out in the wild. Millions more when you realize your search results are personalized to you and you alone.” There is still only one search box, but there are as many different result sets as there are visitors to Google’s site. While my mom misunderstood her car, she at least had a mental model of cars from before computers to believe in. Software with no real life counterpart can be tricky because all we have to go on in terms of creating our stories is an abstract, utilitarian interface like a textbox, search button, and perhaps some basic ideas about servers sending bits to and fro. The same clever design that makes complicated software easy to use makes it hard to truly understand. This confusion can even turn into hysteria as people in a thousand-comment long discussion try blindly to decipher the hidden meanings in the way their friends are ordered on Facebook.</p>

<p>Abstract inventions like search boxes also find their way back into real life in curious ways. I find myself strangely frustrated in offline situations that lack Google’s utility, like a used bookstore with no searchable catalog. But Google has not just changed expectations about the findability of information, it has shaped the way that we ask for it. We used to ask questions of a librarian or an expert, but computers are not yet adept at processing “natural language” so we meet them halfway by reducing our questions to queries composed of keywords and operators. These changes reverberate around the world, and it happens fast. When Google tweaked their interface to instantly show results before users even finish typing a query, half-typed words and phrases immediately started to show up in the referral logs of my website. The progression from posing questions, to assembling queries, to not even typing out half a query, shows that the ways our computers shape us are plainly visible.</p>

<h2>Life in the shadow of technology</h2>

<p>In their paper <a href=""><em>Bias in Computer Systems</em></a> researchers Batya Friedman and Helen Nissenbaum examine the ways in which, “groups or individuals can be systematically and unfairly discriminated against in favor of others by computer systems.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computer systems…are comparatively inexpensive to disseminate, and thus, once developed, a biased system has the potential for widespread impact. If the system becomes a standard in the field, the bias becomes pervasive. If the system is complex, and most are, biases can remain hidden in the code, difficult to pinpoint or explicate, and not necessarily disclosed to users or their clients. Furthermore, unlike in our dealings with biased individuals with whom a potential victim can negotiate, biased systems offer no equivalent means for appeal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even when users are not being intentionally manipulated, there is an opportunity cost of docilely operating within dominant software patterns. Of the three types of bias the authors have identified, we have already encountered two: Preexisting Bias and Technical Bias. “Preexisting Bias has its roots in social institutions, practices, and attitudes.” The computer environment described by McHugh in which we conduct business and pay bills, that literally mimics real world drudgery with its office-like files and folders, is just one example of how interface metaphors can carry not just visual but social conventions from the physical into the digital realm.</p>

<p>While Friedman and Nissenbaum note that almost all instances of computer bias can be classified as either Preexisting or Technical, they identify a third type called Emergent Bias, which is particularly important for artists working with Web 2.0 tools. Emergent bias arises “after a design is completed, as a result of a change in the context or usage of a system.” The hacking and retrofitting of existing software in the service of creative expression or critique is exciting, but assumptions of the software might still be carried by the work. Friedman and Nissenbaum write that any time the way a user wants to work with a system butt up against its constraints, and the work they are doing is disadvantaged as a result, it can be classified as a case of Emergent Bias called “user mismatch.” Unlike victims of bias, however, artists tend to seek out these problematic areas.</p>

<p>In Ann Hirsch’s project <a href="">Scandalishious</a>, she satirizes the “camwhore” culture of YouTube using <a href="">YouTube itself</a>, by taking on a character named Caroline and posting videos of her own. A site dedicated to user generated content can spawn a culture of typical users as well as a group that is critical of them, so it’s hard to tell if using a site to critique how people use a site stretches what is considered a “typical” use of the site. While the videos are funny, Hirsch has also published serious writing on this topic, such as her brief essay, <a href=""><em>Women, Sexuality, and The Internet</em></a>. However, Hirsch’s work and others like it may actually be strongest at the points where it becomes unclear if the artist is omnisciently addressing big problems and questions or enjoying being a part of the scene.</p>

<p>On platforms such as YouTube neither the “typical” cultures that arise nor the people who examine and critique those cultures are disadvantaged by design, because the companies behind Web 2.0 tools are simply providing free web services to all.</p>

<p>Artists attempting to be critical of our relationship to social networking sites should follow the money back to advertising, where they will find irony in embedding themselves within the systems they seek to explicate. In <em>You Are Not a Gadget</em>, Jaron Lanier writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The customers of social networks are not the members of those networks…the whole idea of fake friendship, is just bait laid by the lords of the clouds to lure hypothetical advertisers…who could someday show up…If the revenue never appears, then a weird imposition of a database-as-reality ideology will have colored generations of teen peer group and romantic experiences for no business or other purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tumblr, the only one of the four major tools mentioned that does not heavily plaster content pages with display advertising, appears to be taking a financial loss and burning through venture capital money to grow their userbase and integrate their product more deeply into users’ lives. Starting a conversation about how computers shape our lives is important, but responses that don’t functionally uproot those systems will have bizarrely turned artists working with the internet today into a product whose criticality is being sold back to advertisers.</p>

<h2>In defense of building tools</h2>

<p>Is it possible to make pointed critiques by changing platforms rather than contributing to them? In <a href=""><em>Bless the Toolmakers</em></a>, Robin Sloan argues that producing content is a more resonant form of communication than building tools:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t think about Steve Jobs when I’m using my MacBook. I don’t think about Thomas Knoll when I’m using Photoshop. I don’t think about the sublime inventor of the kitchen table (her name lost to history) when I sit here at mine. (I don’t think about the Ikea designer who made this particular model, either.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the author may be more present in content than platform, the importance of addressing technology on the level of its underlying systems cannot be overstated. It doesn’t matter how critical what you’re saying is, the companies who thrive on user generated content would like very much for you to continue generating it at length. <em>Content</em> is an icky word for a reason: it doesn’t make any distinction between what is being said or to whom; it is something measured in click-throughs and conversion rates rather than poignancy or intelligence. In Marshall McLuhan’s famous words, “the medium is the message.” Power lies with the makers of mediums, or to use terms less slippery within an art context: tools and platforms. Though design patterns, behaviors, and world views can swiftly circulate between the real and the virtual, it is rare to see users—artists especially—being the ones to create tools directly.</p>

<p>Creating new systems means anticipating the full extent of biases and very intentionally keeping or discarding them. There can be no compromise. Even a tiny adjustment to the way an existing system introduces bias might necessitate throwing out everything on which it is built and starting from scratch. Tasking artists with building alternative systems for digital existence may seem overly pragmatic. In addition to the work it takes to dissect the ways computers warp our relationships with ourselves and each other, creating tools that address this requires experience with code. However, organizations like Creativetime have been pushing hard at the idea of <a href="">“useful art”</a> that seem to be nothing more than a thinly veiled draft of artists into the humanitarian workforce. It’s not in so-called useful art, but on the internet where platforms, “blur the forms of art and everyday life, and emphasize participation, dialogue, and community engagement.” Experiments with technology have the potential to go beyond the symbolism of protest, the red tape of politicians, and the bureaucracy of non-profit organizations in their potential to create change. “[Technologists] tinker with your philosophy by direct manipulation of your cognitive experience, not indirectly, through argument. It takes only a tiny group of engineers to create technology that can shape the entire future of human experience with incredible speed,” writes Jaron Lanier.</p>

<p>Journalism has been one of the more progressive fields in terms of adopting custom-made tools and interfaces. Perhaps this is because, in the words of <a href="">Clay Shirky</a>, newspapers are seeing, “old stuff get broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place.” In a blog post titled <a href=""><em>In Defense of Building Tools</em></a>, Derek Willis, a developer for the New York Times, writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good tool doesn’t just make it easier for a reporter to create a story. It actually seeds the story, or makes it possible for more people in a newsroom to collaborate. When you have data but no tool, you become a gatekeeper of a sorts – which is appropriate in many circumstances, but not all. I can’t possibly know what my colleagues are thinking about, considering or being alerted to, but I can make it easier for them to test out theories and do some exploration on their own. Some of them prefer to do their own work, and we certainly miss some opportunities for apps that way. But others consult with me quite a bit, since they now have a much better idea of what we have and what we might be able to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Willis’s examples are tailored towards journalism but his logic applies soundly to artists working with the internet too. Tools have the potential to exponentially improve the ability for collaboration and understanding. In one interesting experiment from the <em>New York Times</em>, comment threads for highly discussed articles are been elegantly improved by integrating hard data from users that allows thousands of responses to be mapped onto a <a href="">zeitgeist visualizing matrix</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="../content/124.user-generated-content//nytimesmatrix.png" /></figure>

<p>The authors of a book called <em>Newsgames</em> even pose that journalism has a lot to learn from videogames! As a rich experience that cannot exist on any previous medium alone, the authors propose that so called “newsgames” could teach people the dynamics of complicated systems through simulated first-hand experience, rather than by inference from an account of events or by reading dry explanations. Newspapers and other “old media” employ a paid content publishing model, as opposed to relying on the explosion of free user generated content. Even in the supplemental role that the authors suggest newsgames might play, their vision is impressive for how it looks beyond just content to systems.</p>

<figure><img src="../content/124.user-generated-content//bloomplanetary.jpeg" /></figure>

<p>Knowing how even the mundane aspects of computing like files and folders can filter back into the way we think and behave, what if we redesigned these utilitarian aspects of computing to incorporate more inventive modes of working? <a href="">Planetary</a> is an iPad app by a company called Bloom which visualizes a user’s iTunes library in the form of a galaxy rather than a spreadsheet. While at first I was put off by how superfluous this seems, the designers believe “these Instruments aren’t merely games or graphics. They’re new ways of seeing what’s important.” What if instead of files and folders, we visualized what we’re working on like a solar system? Ideas could be set into orbit at different speeds, which would determine how which things appear together, rather than folder hierarchies. I often find myself navigating a crowded array of overlapping windows, which seems symptomatic of multitasking or ADD, so how would a system that takes this mindset as a starting point ideally work?</p>

<p>These bespoke systems don’t have to save the world. What did files and folders ever do for you? Lanier seem to hint that popular interfaces become pervasive more by conspiracy or agressive promotion than on merit anyway. Simply introducing different kinds of arbitrariness may lead to accidental discoveries about the way we work and live.</p>

<p>In addition to new interfaces, the “front-end” of a system, there is also the possibility of creating radical new back-ends. These low level designs, while less visually compelling, they are conceptualy mindblowing. <a href=""><em>Wired</em> magazine</a> has called Xanadu, a system proposed by Ted Nelson (inventor of the word “hypertext”18) both, “the most radical computer dream of the hacker era,” and, “the longest-running vaporware project in the history of computing.” Xanadu assumes an entirely different relationship with “content” than we are used to. The web, as we know it, is made up of documents which link to each other. Xanadu’s key difference is it’s rigid structure, in which all links must be bi-directional. For example, if you wanted to take a piece of one document and put it into another, instead of “copy and pasting” you would do something called “transcluding.” While on a functional level copy and pasting takes a series of characters in one document and replicates them in another, transclusion less redundantly embeds a linked version of the original document into the new one. Good design might make the interaction of transcluding no more complicated than a copy and paste, but transclusions are more meaningful because they can be followed like links from use to use. If the author of the transcluded fragment had taken it from somewhere else, a user could continue to follow the phrase through all of its uses. Xanadu would create radically different possibilities and limitations in both digital and physical space. In fact, Nelson envisioned that Xanadu’s linked attribution could be tied into a micropayment system that would end copyright disputes and provide content creators with steady income unlike the theories of “free” which have popped up to explain our present situation. A collage of images made with source material from ten different people would be traceable back to each of them and payments as small as a few cents could trickle back to the image owners for every single use. In the bi-directionally linked world of Xanadu, the metaphor of files and folders becomes unimportant. <a href="">Nelson evocatively describes</a> flying through documents in 3D gaming space. With the continuous exchange of metaphors between screen and life, de-emphasizing hierarchies of files and folders on screen might open up the way we think when we’re away from screens too. Such specific systems may never be of use to larges sets of people, but experiments with more opinionated software are an exciting prospect.</p>

<p>The way things are now is more like a pile up of metaphors and recycled code than laws of interaction which are set in stone. As can be seen in the examples above, designing computer systems is an unprecedentedly fast and direct way of altering how people experience the world and relate to each other. In the coming years, as code literacy becomes more important, artists will be empowered to create new platforms with the conceptual backbone lacking in today’s popular offerings. Artists who are already thinking critically about the way networked technology orders our experience should go beyond generating content to become makers of mediums, if only so that whatever comes after Web 2.0 offers more to artists than free hosting of its own critique.</p>

But for the most part, he was fluent, and he took pleasure in the aptness of his own phrases. Although inconvenienced by his disorder, Nelson is nonetheless proud of it. &#38;quot;Attention Deficit Disorder was coined by regularity chauvinists,&#38;quot; he remarked. &#38;quot;Regularity chauvinists are people who insist that you have got to do the same thing every time, every day, which drives some of us nuts.

The inventor's hummingbird mind and his inability to keep track of anything left him relatively helpless. He wanted to be a writer and a filmmaker, but he needed a way to avoid getting lost in the frantic multiplication of associations his brain produced. His great inspiration was to imagine a computer program that could keep track of all the divergent paths of his thinking and writing.

<p>This is a draft. Maybe I will take it down after I get the victory thrill of posting it. Or some day it will get edited.</p>

<hr />

<p>For at least the past couple of years, my reccuring daydream has been interacting with constellations of thoughts and references in some sort of <a href="http://awurl.com/BBvtWPBx3">hypermedia</a> space: <a href="http://arborjs.org/">nodes</a>, <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/journal/view/217">spheres</a>, facets. The <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/5579">Snarkmarket</a> guys and <a href="http://blog.frankchimero.com/post/6984494439">Frank Chimero</a> are also on to this. One day I will read something and feel the hypothetical ecstasy of some awesome information-space tool, the next day I&#38;#8217;ll look at a stupid infographic, read <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html">a story about universal-library vaporware</a>, or see bit of design too clever for its own good and begin to doubt that better tools will make much of a difference. Either way I keep coming back to this desire to look in from outside at swirling systems of thought, to let the public inside a brain in action.</p>

<p>A beacon of design optimism for me lately has been the work of <a href="http://samizdat.cc">Christian Swinehart</a>. He&#38;#8217;s a designer who codes with a background in neuroscience. I&#38;#8217;ve been digging into his RISD MFA thesis, a little book called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/pattern-recognition/3148356"><em>Pattern Recognition</em></a>. This bit about the linearity of language versus the grok-ability of visual systems just <em>gets me</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Through a degree of parallelism seen few other places in nature, the brain is able to process huge amounts of sensory information in real time and without our having to expend any mental effort. Yet the irony of our conscious experience is the linear character our thoughts take on when we express ourselves using words.</p>
  
  <p>Despite the primacy of language in constructing ideas and models of the world around us, there are places where our parallel nature peeks through and this seriality of thought is exposed for the façade that it is. Perhaps the most vivid is the ability of our visual system to process diagrams containing hundreds of data points in a single glance and immediately see patterns that would elude us when confronted with an equivalent table of figures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a refreshingly un-Tufte-an lack of pretension Swinehart cites <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/worldsfair/upload/2006/11/digging2.jpg">Richard Scarry&#38;#8217;s book <em>What Do People Do All Day?</em></a> as having some of the earliest graphics he interpreted, and still some of the best. (&#38;#8220;It speaks in formal terms its audience will embrace (fuzzy animals), has a structure that rewards investigation at multiple zoom levels, and leaves you with an understanding of both the parts and the system as a whole.&#38;#8221;) What Swinehart is pointing out is that Scarry&#38;#8217;s graphics are <strong>highly synthesized</strong> for presentation to a specific audience: kids.</p>

<p>All organization is a form of synthesis. Computers are <em>terrible</em> just terrible at it—even the most basic kinds of synthesis performed easily by humans. Maybe I&#38;#8217;m making this up but it has something to do with the parallelism Swinehart talks about. Even Google&#38;#8217;s creepy post-human singularity-style indexing and ranking—which is pretty damn good at synthesizing which pages are important—is based on code written by humans. Until we can create machines that go beyond self-replication into self-invention, we must teach the machines that we want to replace us. As Kevin Slavin notes in his talk <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world.html">How Algorithms Shape Our World</a>, it gets scary (and interesting?) when we stop being able to read the output of the code we write. Then things happen like a financial meltdown caused by wacky trading between autonomous <em>non-human</em> computer systems.</p>

<p>In my hypothetical brain constellation, the ground shifts too fast for a foundation of human synthesis to make sense. A computer, with its strengths and weaknesses will have to be responsible for drawing the map. I absolutely imagine that these brain-contellations will be regularly edited and moderated by humans, but even if I were to employ my own brain-librarian (another strange dream of mine) they would still not be able to work fast enough to index everything and tie it together by hand.</p>

<p>Today I stumbled across this paraphrasing of <a href="http://www.1972municholympics.co.uk/">Otl Aicher</a> that I had saved on my computer a few months ago, &#38;#8220;a designer is a kind of moralist whose activity consists of evaluation and whose task is to create order in a conflict-field of heterogeneous factors.&#38;#8221; It&#38;#8217;s not easy. It reminded me why I&#38;#8217;ve been turning <a href="http://adamflorin.com/work/e-flux-journal-layout-generator">Adam Florin&#38;#8217;s e-flux layout generator</a> over in my mind, not because it&#38;#8217;s particularly complicated, but the idea of automated design is fascinating.</p>

<p>I started but didn&#38;#8217;t finish Marvin Minsky&#38;#8217;s awesome/frightening/dubious book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind">The Society of Mind</a> earlier in the year that also attempts to break abstract actions like laying out a page into smaller and smaller sub-processes. At a certain level of granularity, maybe it starts to become believable that we&#38;#8217;re just simple systems of great scale. Fractal-like.</p>

<p>I&#38;#8217;m 62% through James Gleick&#38;#8217;s book <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/chaos-making-new-science-ebook/B000AJYVB0/B004Q3RRPI">Chaos: Making a New Science</a>, which is like the hardcore-nerdy scientific cousin of some of these whispy abstract thoughts. I&#38;#8217;d been wanting to read Gleick&#38;#8217;s book The Information, but then one day Chaos was on sale in the Kindle store for $3. Humans are rational like that. Sometimes it gets a little heavily into math and either my eyes start to glaze over or I start wishing (not really) that I had followed a different life path and become a Computer Science major. It&#38;#8217;s well written. There are nice pictures. I like to read about the quirks of scientists, &#38;#8220;Even Feigenbaum’s friends were wondering whether he was ever going to produce any work of his own&#38;#8230;he did not seem interested in devoting his own research to any problem that might pay off. &#38;#8221; Also, the horrendous politics of the scientific community put the art world and office politics to shame.</p>

<p>Another nice part of having a Kindle: <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> on the beach. It&#38;#8217;s a revelation that has me wondering, as somebody who hates eye-tiring screen-reading but loves things for the screen, why I waited so long. It also caused me to start more actively differentiating between <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/">formless and definite texts</a>.  I&#38;#8217;m now collecting things which are either <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:caseygollan/t:to-read">too good or difficult in their screen-presentation to be converted into plaintext</a>. Printed books I read about online go in that bucket too. <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/how-digital-detectives-deciphered-stuxnet/all/1">This Wired story</a> looks particularly nice. So does <a href="http://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/9/mao__king_kong__and_the_future_of_the_book">Triplecanopy</a>.</p>

<p>A weird part of using a Kindle is seeing exactly what percentage you&#38;#8217;re at in a text (62%?!) as the primary indicator of position. The percentages are a little misleading because nobody (I hope) reads through all the end notes and random crap in most books, which can account for a good portion.  iBooks in contrast shows an unchanging image of stacked pages, surely just to infuriate anti-skeuomorphs. In his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/5">epic review of Mac OS X Lion</a>  John Siracusa railed against the skeuomorphism prevalent in Apple&#38;#8217;s latest update, writing, &#38;#8220;These graphics are writing checks this interface can&#38;#8217;t cash.&#38;#8221; Good line.</p>

<p>All this app developers getting sued over software patents bullshit that&#38;#8217;s been going around reminds me of a line from <em>Chaos</em>: &#38;#8220;It was a legitimate question. If one scientist announces that a thing is probably true, and another demonstrates it with rigor, which one has done more to advance science? Is the making of a conjecture an act of discovery? Or is it just a cold-blooded staking of a claim?&#38;#8221; Gleick is talking about how tensions can crop up between between immaterial theorists and rigorous experimenters in science, I like the phrase &#38;#8220;cold-blooded staking of a claim,&#38;#8221; though, applied to patent trolls. For example, Amazon has patented &#38;#8220;one click&#38;#8221; checkout as a &#38;#8220;business process,&#38;#8221; meaning competitors like Barnes and Noble actually have to make people click twice. How is the patent system helping foster innovation, again?? Not to mention the &#38;#8220;patent incubator&#38;#8221; companies that exist purely to patent ideas and then run after anybody who uses them for license fees. Terrifying.</p>

<p>I don&#38;#8217;t remember exactly how I stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.06/patents_pr.html">June 2006 Wired article by Evan Ratliff</a> on independent patent-buster Greg Aharonian, but it&#38;#8217;s awesome. Aharonian isn&#38;#8217;t a lawyer, he&#38;#8217;s a programmer who built and started maintaining his own private database of software, something which is generally poorly cataloged. &#38;#8220;For the buck-fifty it cost to get a copy of the patent, you could get a listing of a lot of source code, and it was quite valuable,&#38;#8221; he explains, &#38;#8220;So I started tracking that and just added it to my database. But I really wasn&#38;#8217;t paying much attention to the patents.&#38;#8221; He didn&#38;#8217;t really have any success selling the software catalog to anyone until software patent litigation started heating up. Then he found himself sitting on an invaluable database of &#38;#8220;prior art&#38;#8221; used to invalidate dubious patents. As its creator, Aharonian surely has an intimate knowledge of the shape of the information in his database. Ratliff even attributes Aharonian&#38;#8217;s sucess to, &#38;#8220;his own software expertise and renowned searching capabilities.&#38;#8221;</p>

<p>Artist Harm van den Dorpel (I like this page from his old site of <a href="http://harmvandendorpel.com/first">supposed firsts of mechanically reproducible media</a>) tweeted that he has <a href="http://harmvandendorpel.com/">a new website that&#38;#8217;s &#38;#8220;a non-linear relational/associative network.&#38;#8221;</a>. As it turns out, there is no navigation besides viewing one main text, image, or video (called an &#38;#8220;association&#38;#8221;) and then navigating to another by clicking a thumbnail or excerpt. Each association presents slightly different related thumbnnails.</p>

<p>Here&#38;#8217;s something that I wrote about it one night as I was falling asleep in my notebook: &#38;#8220;I have crazy dreams about working with ideas using node-based software. As far as I no [sic], nothing good exists yet, but my interest is piqued every time I come across non-conventional ways of interacting with information.</p>

<p>Familiarity is a huge factor in reducing frustration. I found that I was basically unable to use Holmberg&#38;#8217;s [sic] website because there was no way to gauge the shape of its content, like looking through a box of clippings with a flashlight, or walking through a gallery with blinders on, only more intelligent because there is literally no ground, the entire world is shifting based on some secret relevance every time you navigate to a new item.</p>

<p>Maybe we need more opinionated interfaces. We are conditioned by Google and iTunes to treat every interface like a machine designed to give us something we want, and if it does not it is broken. Don Norman on desire lines. Need to be better about writing in full sentences.&#38;#8221;</p>

<p>At that point I think I passed out and woke up with a new area of ink splotches on my sheets from where I fell asleep before capping the pen. Based on the blotches, it&#38;#8217;s the second time that&#38;#8217;s happened.</p>

<p>I had clicked around for a while and felt kind frustrated because I found myself going in small loops through what was obviously a large dataset. I looked at the URL structure, for example:</p>

<p><code><a href="http://harmvandendorpel.com/associations/559">http://harmvandendorpel.com/associations/559</a></code></p>

<p>and started paging through the items numerically. The three-digit number beginning with five was a clue that this is a large collection (it appears to contain just under 600 items). Occasionally an ID, such as <code>/1</code> brought me to a broken page. Working upwards through the associations, it appeared that each item was in a relatively similar grouping to those before and after it, but every couple digits I would see a shift entirely in the related items. What is amazing to me is how an incredibly simple system (as I  suspect this is, but cannot quite put a finger on it) can be completely opaque to outsiders. Minsky writes about a similar idea in The Society of Mind, &#38;#8220;When you accelerate your car by pressing on the gas pedal, this is not what does the work; it is merely a signal to make the engine push the car. Similarly, rotating the steering wheel is merely a signal that makes the steering mechanism turn the car.&#38;#8221; In this case, clicking the thumbnails is not what does the associative work, and I don&#38;#8217;t need to see the underlying web of connections between associations to move between them.  Though I do find it frustrating to have that map withheld.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/harmvddorpel/status/70900846526857216">a tweet</a> Van den Dorpel writes, &#38;#8220;Where in the past storing something in an archive meant its death, contemporary archival aesthetics invoke life instead.&#38;#8221; For traditional intents and purposes: looking for information about the artist and his work, the website is dysfunctional—or at least non-traditionally-functional. It provides only a way to get lost-er, though that would seem to be the artist&#38;#8217;s intent.</p>

<p>This issue of opacity is why even if it were possible for me to comprehensively map out nodes and links between thoughts in a 1:1 way, it might not be that interesting to let the public into that system. Somewhere between Aharonian, who can make a racket and a living off of his aptitude at searching his private patent database, and the un-synthesized, out of grasp relational simplicity of Van den Dorpel&#38;#8217;s non-linear archive is the work of Christian Swinehart.</p>

<p>His work, which he details in Pattern Recognition, leverages design not in the sense of making things pretty but as a method of synthesizing patterns and systems into something more understandable. In Chaos, Gleick quotes physicist Robert Shaw quoting historian Thomas Kuhn, &#38;#8220;You don’t see something until you have the right metaphor to let you perceive it.&#38;#8221;</p>

<p>Combining brute force and elegance, Swinehart visualizes the hell out of systems which, similar to Van den Dorpel&#38;#8217;s site, have blinders built into their default usage. His best known project, which was my initial point of entry into his work, is <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/">a visualization of the classic Choose Your Own Adventure books</a> of the 80&#38;#8217;s. Each of the books is visualized as raw choice data, a diagram simultaneously showing all possible paths, and a decision tree. Several of the diagrams are also presented in animated form and one of the books is &#38;#8220;playable&#38;#8221; online. In plotting every possible option on the same canvas, Swinehart reduces the seemingly boundless interactivity of the CYOA books to finite maps. Browsing abstractions of the books and reading <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/">Swinehart&#38;#8217;s findings about their structure</a> is a totally different experience than actually traversing the books themselves. And like the Misnky passage above, you don&#38;#8217;t need to understand the structural arc of the book to use it and have it work for you as entertainment, but there is something profound in understanding the system of each book and the series as a whole. In going outside sanctioned form of navigation, Swinehart also uncovered an easter egg: an isolated ending unreachable by following directions. It seems as if the series was just waiting for somebody like Swinehart to come along and crack it. Achievment unlocked!</p>

<p>In providing a playable book, a visual dissection of the system, and a thorough, eloquent piece of writing about the project, Swinehart covers many bases from game design, to information design, to journalism. The authors of <a href="http://newsgames.gatech.edu/">Newsgames: Journalism at Play</a> write, &#38;#8220;Videogames offer a new model for infographics, one that might combine the analytical sophistication of Playfair&#38;#8217;s and Maynard&#38;#8217;s early infographics with the emotional context of later approaches.&#38;#8221; They seem to suggest that the most potent experiences that will come out of work at the intersection of these areas will be the result of finding a way to unify the aspects which are usually left distinct, as in Swinehart&#38;#8217;s project. However, they are quick to admit the problem that presents:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good games depict system dynamics rather than narrating specific accounts&#38;#8230;Some of the subtleties that make the system rich (and make the article fascinating) are lost in the game-a situation probably attributable to the designers&#38;#8217; desire to make the game manageable, learnable, and playable in short sessions. Nevertheless, the article provides only a disconnected, mathematical account&#38;#8230;while the game offers a synthetic experience of the practice, one that unifies the disconnected algorithms of the print piece into a holistic account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Swinehart&#38;#8217;s playable book actually includes not just the original &#38;#8220;game&#38;#8221; but one of his path visualizations which updates as you navigate the text, thoughtfully integrating the primary-document and its analysis. It seems, however, like games might have something more to teach design.</p>

<p>Minsky writes that, &#38;#8220;players of computer games use symbols to invoke the processes inside their complicated game machines without the slightest understanding of how they work.&#38;#8221; But could games also be used to move players away from their reliance on the interface? To teach them about the systems beneath the symbols? When games stop modeling reality and veer into fiction or invention, they must find ways of helping the player understand the laws of the game space. Games go to great lengths with printed or digital manuals and interactive tutorials designed to familiarize the user with the game world. But interface design typically provides no clues, even when the rules have changed.</p>

<p>If Van den Dorpel&#38;#8217;s non-linear relational archive is imagined as it could exist in physical space it would work like this: from a curtain behind which hundreds of objects are stored, one object is brought out and placed on a stage, flanked by photographs of several related objects. If you point to a related object photograph, the object is brought onto the stage and all the photographs in front of the curtain are re-evaluated for their relevance to the new main object. The irrelevant photos are sent back behind the curtain, replaced in the foreground by new relevant ones. While this system <em>works</em> in real life, it is not fast, efficient or practical in the ways virtual space and relational databases afford.</p>

<p>To allow the user of the physical archive to ask questions of the assistants shuffling objects and images back and forth, for example, &#38;#8220;how do you choose the relevant items?&#38;#8221; would quickly reveal the system&#38;#8217;s inner workings. The other option would be to brute force the system, requesting each object in numerical order. Perhaps with Van den Dorpel&#38;#8217;s archive, the intent is to direct the users to a specific experience or understanding without revealing the system&#38;#8217;s coarse logic. But Swinehart&#38;#8217;s method of reverse-engineering: working outside of the suggested navigation, taking thorough notes, and charting the results, presents an alternative kind of understanding.</p>

   <title>Mixing Metaphors: Skeuomorphic, Hyper, and Fantasy Interfaces</title>
   <id>tag:www.caseyagollan.com,2015:/mixing-metaphors/</id>
   <updated>2013-03-27T20:26:20+11:00</updated>
   <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://www.caseyagollan.com/mixing-metaphors/" />
   <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          
          
            <p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklds3T9x91qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are some valid arguments for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorphism">skeuomorphic design</a>, for example mimicking the turning of real-life pages in a virtual book on the iPad, besides &#38;#8220;wow, that looks cool!&#38;#8221; One good one is that <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/441478284/how-real">we&#38;#8217;re in a transitional period</a> where mimicry is being used to help people learn how to interact with these new touch devices, and that skeuomorphism will be replaced by less decorative interfaces in due time. There are also the criticisms: some <a href="http://inessential.com/2011/03/31/torn_paper_derangement_syndrome_tpds_">vehemently oppose</a> any computer interface with a torn paper edge and others are trying to invent <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2011/04/idea_a_new_save_icon.html">less dated replacements for the &#38;#8220;save&#38;#8221; icon</a> (which is still commonly represented by a floppy disk). <a href="http://calvetica.com/">Calvetica</a>, a minimalist calendar replacement for iPhone, is an interesting example of an app which eschews fussy realistic design, but doesn&#38;#8217;t necessarily implement <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view">crazy new functionalities</a>—it&#38;#8217;s just a good, clean, basic calendar.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkldwruNun1qzrmn8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Style issues aside, the most important argument <em>against</em> skeuomorphism is that imitating the physical world on screen stops applications from taking advantage of new kinds of interactions which can only exist in a world unburdened by ordinary physics or materiality. Ted Nelson, who coined the term &#38;#8220;hypertext&#38;#8221; in 1963, has this vision of <a href="http://transliterature.org/">where digital literature is headed</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A document is not necessarily a simulation of paper.  In the most general sense, a document is a package of ideas created by human minds and addressed to human minds, intended for the furtherance of those ideas and those minds.  Human ideas manifest as text, connections, diagrams and more: thus how to store them and present them is a crucial issue for civilization.</p>
  
  <p>The furtherance of the ideas, and the furtherance of the minds that present them and take them in, are the real objectives.  And so what is important in documents is the expression, reception and re-use of ideas.  Connections, annotations, and most especially re-use&#38;#8212; the traceable flow of content among documents and their versions&#38;#8212; must be our central objectives, not the simulation of paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nelson also made this illustration of what documents might look like in his world:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklg5bM7dV1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Documents wrap around each other like donuts and pick-up sticks, float through space, and link bi-directionally. Nelson&#38;#8217;s ideas are interesting, but <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html">have some fundamental flaws</a> and therefore have failed to catch on. Still, I can&#38;#8217;t help looking at his Transliterature spec and thinking that he may have been on to new functionalities which transcend skeuomorphism.</p>

<p>I was reminded of all this today because for the first time in recent memory I came across an interface that wasn&#38;#8217;t necessarily skeuomorphic or hyper. <a href="http://planetary.bloom.io/">Planetary</a> is a free iPad app that allows you to navigate your music library as if it were a solar system.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklf4z5RrY1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The demo video below gives a sense of how it works: you select a letter to narrow down artists, then tap through a &#38;#8220;galaxy&#38;#8221; a few times towards an individual song. After poking around for a few minutes I realized that Planetary is essentially the same hierarchical <code>artist &#38;gt; album &#38;gt; song</code> navigation in use on every iPod, but dressed up as a spinning 3D galaxy. Planetary isn&#38;#8217;t skeuomorphic because it isn&#38;#8217;t referencing the conventions of any existing physical or virtual organization <em>for music</em> and it isn&#38;#8217;t hyper because it proposes no new functionality. Rather, Planetary represents a kind of mixing of metaphors—an orbital solar system and a hierarchical music library—to create what I think of as a fantasy interface.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/23168163?title=0&#38;amp;byline=0&#38;amp;portrait=0" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>I&#38;#8217;m sure there are tons more that I can&#38;#8217;t remember, but the other fantasy interface that comes to mind is <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/3990446010/speeder-reader-an-experiment-in-the-future-of">Speeder Reader</a>, an experimental book-as-arcade-game that poses the question: &#38;#8220;what is it like to drive through a book?&#38;#8221; In the photograph below, a woman uses Speeder Reader to drive through the science fiction story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podkayne_of_Mars"><em>Podkayne of Mars</em></a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lklg1s3NQZ1qzrmn8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/a_place_to_talk/">Mandy Brown</a> recently posted about <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>, an app which makes a &#38;#8220;magazine&#38;#8221; out of your social media streams, as a far more subtle but equally interesting example of an interface which mixes metaphors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flipboard aggregates content from your social graph in really lovely ways, but the juxtaposition of oral culture in an essentially literate design doesn’t always make sense. It’s quite odd to see your friend’s tweet about their breakfast burrito elevated to a strikingly designed pull quote. The pull quote is a design pattern that emerged from a culture of publishing—from a process by which an editor would carefully select a bit of text that, when extracted and enlarged, would resonate with the greater work. But here, there is no greater work, and no editor: only the blind act of an algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike Nelson, who over-ambitiously sought to reinvent the way we use and create information, the creators of Planetary describe their work as creating, &#38;#8220;pop-cultural instruments for data expression and exploration.&#38;#8221; In the realm of cool stuff, Planetary is delightful to tap around in and may in fact encourage a different kind of exploration of music libraries (which in their current incarnation resemble spreadsheets). However, the logic—or lack thereof—behind these <em>beautiful!</em> and <em>fun!</em> mixed metaphor interfaces is something that I&#38;#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on.</p>

            <p>I've had richer experiences reading books than looking at art first-hand. I've thought of sculptures—100 shape-shifting sculptures a minutes—and then been done with them. To bring sculptures into the light and not let them play out is a betrayal of the existence of objects—the necessity of which is debatable in and of itself.</p>

<p>Models acknowledge their beauty in a way that artists keep refusing through production. Sculptural production is increasingly antiquated. The artist of today needs to be a kind of model. To offer themselves. To privilege their process, their presence and their existence over their works. Refraction between object, artist, and audience creates and amplifies ego. The artist as art is beyond ego. Sometimes it drains me. I wish I could think by making and present you with my turds. It seems divine to have your progress visible, marked with milestones, verifiable by yourself and others. To live and work in your head means having to prove yourself to others. There is nothing to point to except one's own nebulousness. But the challenge increases the reward of the work. On days where I wake up too exhausted to converse, can my work still exist? Should it? The answer to both, I think, is not really. But does it exist without you, the viewer? Unlike a sculpture, the answer is a resounding yes.</p>

<p>Photographers steal from models, who expend their energy and focus on sharpening what is beautiful about themselves. I want to be proud of a stream of thought, or a few hours spent on the Internet like a model is proud of a look they gave. I have something to offer. I'm available in response, but want to widen the circles. Why have I come to feel like a model with the dual responsibility to make something from myself rather than just be? Not talking about surface-level appearances here. If I wanted to appear as an artist I would make art—which we could probably still talk about—but it would be a gross feeling attempt at fitting in.</p>

<p>A pendulum swings until it reaches stasis. Physical production is decreasingly human territory. Let robots reap the fields, sew my clothes, and fold my laundry. Industry and production, even in the sacred and personal realm of art, are the new domesticity. Artists freed from production are like women freed from the kitchen. What can we do beyond cook meals, which we have been doing with various degrees of placidity and growing discomfort for years?</p>

<p>There are lots of things I want to try but the first is to be. Not just to be, it is hard. I am a humanist but a futurist too. Let's not go back to plowing the fields for some romantic notion of finding ourselves. That sounds like giving up, or crushing the flowers to stop the spring. Deport artists who want to labor like farmhands to the farms. To start, try untwisting the way we have come to talk about ourselves.</p>

<p>This conversation is not a sculpture. I do not wish to make a sculpture now or ever. Why halt work at a construction site? Because at its core this place is a breeding ground for ideas. I am not saying that by eliminating sculpture you can or should or will be able to work faster in your head. I do not believe in efficiency, on principle. Working hard doesn't count if you're working on the wrong problems.</p>

<p>I am asking this room to not produce. To each hone in on and cultivate what is beautiful about yourself. I am begging that we waste no more cycles discussing the merits of artifacts because we are sophisticated enough, I should hope, to not require props. If we obliterate the idea of the conversation piece, the conversation can wander into wonderful places.</p>

<h3>Classmate Responses:</h3>

<p>Erin:</p>

<blockquote><p>This piece seemed really appropriate for your personality. I think in a lot of work of yours that I seen, you tend to focus on your wit and interest in social systems. In this piece, however, I feel like you began to address another really central part of your identity as an artist: your energy and your body. Despite the fact that a lot of your day is relegated to sitting at a computer or reading or whatever, there appears to be a big chunk of your psyche that is obsessed with movement, and unable to contain your own impulsive energy. Unlike your mind which is often willing to play devil’s advocate or take either side or be indecisive, your body and your movements always seem very self-assured, concrete, and nuanced with a specific style. This isn’t to say that you should make your art about flopping on the ground in front of a room and expounding energy, but rather consider the relationship these kinetic bursts could have to your more logically-minded art work.</p>
<p>About my personal experience with the piece, there was a moment in the beginning when we were all running together as hard as we could. Everyone was passing everyone and we were operating alone for the most part. I still felt very connected to the class and I actually smiled. One of my friends walked an entire circle around Manhattan the other week. It took her 15 hours. I think for part of the walk, people would happen to walk with her, and then she would lose them and find another group in that trajectory.</p></blockquote>

<p>John:</p>

<blockquote><p>I missed the explanation, but saw you take off. I charged up ahead to catch up wiht you and everyone else. Most people started running. I didnt ask what was going on, but instead chose to follow. As i passed people and worked my way to the head of the pack, i noticed people giving up before the second block. I instinctually wanted to run along side you, as cyclists do in a peloton (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloton). As a more dedicated or physically able pack emerged, I noticed how much less of an impact the running group had, though people still regarded us. Alex and I were the last to drop off, several minutes away from Battery Park, as I had class.</p>
<p>Here are my reactions:</p>
<p>I wish you had started a slower pace and kept it. Though I thnk mayhem was an important element, i think that it was short lived. People might have stayed on longer, especially if you didnt specify how much further. I think that the gap of when people break away is interesting, but i think the more that gap can be pushed further into the future, the stronger the “pack” might be. I don’t think that the chance that the piece might fall on its face is potentially interesting in this particular piece.</p>
<p>I think there was something interesting about how you would start and stop periodcally and sometimes allow others to catch up, and sometimes look back to see if we were following you. i think these moments of eye contact made me want to keep up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Danae:</p>

<blockquote><p>in the beginning,standing on the corner, when you turned to us and said “OK now we are going to run as far as we can south for 30 minutes” your urge for us to start excited me but i was nervous. for a moment i started thinking about what we were running from or what we were running towards.this confused me, i felt afraid thinking that something was after us, childlike feelings almost. after a few seconds I began to feel emotional because I would turn my head and see the others who were struggling to catch up and i felt bad so i would stop to see if they could catch up. it was about the struggle for me now. i struggled too, my stomach pain kicked in very quickly and i gave up, i could people in the distance running as i turned back to walk towards school, i felt disappointed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Madalyn:</p>

<blockquote><p>in response to marys question- i think we are both abandoned and de-hooked. allowed the decision to continue or discontinue.</p>
<p>i am not a runner.</p>
<p>there were two points that stand out in my mind cinematically,</p>
<p>the first- all of us running next to the cooper hotel, staring bystanders half ambivalent, us half smiling or laughing, panting together. we made a scene. the second- losing each other in what seemed a millisecond, there and gone. i was done, we lost sight of each other. satisfied i stopped. i am not a runner.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nadja:</p>

<blockquote><p>i was thinking about how it all started in the classroom and how we were quite slow and didn’t get it at first, leading to you waiting for us outside. i’m wondering what would’ve happened if you wouldn’t leave before we were all with you. not that you would nicely wait for us, but that you would stress us and pull us out. that would leave us just running without knowing the purpose of it or how long we would go on. i think i would’ve liked it.</p>
<p>because now there was this awareness of the time limit. for me it really became a competition, not who would run the fastest, but a competition about who would make it to the end. i guess that’s also a personality thing – i hate losing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Phoebe:</p>

<blockquote><p>Is running a sign of weakness? Interesting question. I think in some contexts yes, like running away from something, although I don’t think you were running away from your presentation as John suggested. I think in this context running was a marker of commitment. Who could run to the end and more importantly – who wanted to.</p>
<p>What does it mean to run away from Cooper as a pack? We can run away from Cooper only in theory and in spirit. Who would run away from a scholarship to an art school in NYC? Not many.</p>
<p>My gut response to the proposal was one of dismay. Not because I don’t like running but because I wasn’t wearing clothing that I could efficiently and comfortably run in. When I started to get sore feet I started to be angry at you. I wanted to run, to prove I could keep up, but I knew my feet would hurt so much the next day after running in boots. And my tight tight pants. Why didn’t you warn me? When I got the stitch from recently eaten food, I called it quits. Again why didn’t you warn me – I wouldn’t have eaten. But this is just me being selfish, I wanted to keep going, to prove myself. But I knew I wouldn’t in these circumstances. I wasn’t committed enough. And had you warned me and I had been comfortable, it would no longer have been a surprise. It would have been more official – exercise instead of rebellion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Priscilla:</p>

<blockquote><p>I thought this was an interesting piece in making “us” disapear, from either perspective (the leader or the followers). it was frustrating trying to keep up and stay in “existance” and misserably failing and becoming extremely lost, even in a familiar environment. i liked how it was executed sporatically and upbruptly and a fight to try to make sense of it all while keeping present or rather “keeping up” and not getting lost.</p></blockquote>

<p>Alex:</p>

<blockquote><p>HI casey—
<p>here is my experience of the run. When you first ran out the class room door, i left behind. You had told us that we needed our jackets. When we got otuside cooper and you briefed us- told us that we were going to run as far as we could in 30 minutes, i was met with mixed feelings. First, i felt excited. Second. I wished i didnt have my backpack which was carrying my computer and a couple books. Then. I felt challenged and excited by that challenge. How would i run if i were running for my life? ( this is an extreme example, but these are the types of things i remind myself of when, for example, i am told that i have to run in extremely unfavorable attire)</p>
<p>These mixed feelings informed my physical movements. i occasionally sprinted, then slowed down, adjusted clothes, then sprinted again. I wanted to keep up with everyone else. After a few mintues, i stopped completely to take off my scarf and jacket. I caught up to mary and priscilla. I saw nadja running ahead and i wanted to be ahead of her. So, i ran faster to get past her. once i had past her, i took off my sweater, and was now running in as little clothing as i could. I was holding my backpack straps tight so that my backpack would be close and more of a part of my body, rather than a dead weight. I saw you, john danae and Phoebe. I ran as fast as i could to catch up with you all. I enjoyed running past you, but felt a little guilty so i slowed down. It was also more fun to talk to other people while running once in front. – opposed to talking to people in the middle (Mary and Pricilla) – which made me feel really anxious. Finally it was you me an john. John and I both had class at six and needed to get back. As much as i <p>would have loved to go to the very end with you, I was ultimately starving and cutting close to class time.</p>
<p>I liked running as a class. Running to me, represents an extremely competitive activity. Speed, strength, breath control, mental and physical discipline are all things that make someone a good runner. As you sped ahead, you initiated a race of some kind. However, your position as a leader made it mentally difficult to pass by you. There was an unspoken rule that i shouldn’t go too far without you. You are dealing with issues of dictatorship, oppression, community, physical and mental endurance, and for some- torture.</p>
<p>i might write more in the morning.</p></blockquote>

   <title>Built to Last, Built to Decay: Authentic, Self-Reflective, Relationship Building Books in the Age of the iPad</title>

            <p><a href="http://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a>, who clearly <em>gets it</em>, has written (and <em>designed</em>) <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/">an excellent piece</a> on the future of publishing:</p>

<blockquote><p>I propose the following to be considered whenever we think of printing a book:</p>

              <ul><li>The Books We Make <strong>embrace their physicality</strong> — working in concert with the content to illuminate the narrative. </li>
                <li>The Books We Make are <strong>confident in form and usage of material</strong>. </li>
                <li>The Books We Make <strong>exploit the advantages of print</strong>. </li>
                <li>The Books We Make are <strong>built to last</strong></li>
              </ul><p>The result of this is:</p>

              <ul><li>The Books We Make will feel whole and solid in the hands.</li>
                <li>The Books We Make will smell like now forgotten, far away libraries.</li>
                <li>The Books We Make will be something of which even our children — who have fully embraced all things digital — will understand the worth.</li>
                <li>The Books We Make will always remind people that the printed book can be a sculpture for thoughts and ideas.</li>
              </ul><p>Anything less than this will be stepped over and promptly forgotten in the digital march forward. </p>
            <p>Goodbye disposable books.</p> 
            <p>Hello new canvases.</p></blockquote>

<p>I like the distinction between <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/#starts_content">formless and definite content</a> in relation to <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/353396147/i-passed-right-over-this-beautiful-interactive">a container</a>. I highly reccomend reading <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/ipad_and_books/">the entire piece</a>, which also talks about opportunities for <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/371551348/a-new-class-of-content-for-a-new-class-of-device">&#38;#8220;definite&#38;#8221; digital content</a> that are presented by the iPad. The only point I might debate and expand on (not because Craig is wrong, but because he is not taking into account certain possibilities*) is that printed books should be &#38;#8220;built to last.&#38;#8221;</p>

<p>While digital distribution makes sense for high-volume, formless, ephemeral publishing like news and tweets, the fact of the matter is that digital content can exist indefinitely, distributed across millions of hard drives, but a printed object exists in one place at a time and eventually disintegrates.</p>

<p>I&#38;#8217;ve saved a lot of links on the perpetuity of digital information but never created a standardized tag (perhaps I should use: <em>forgetting</em>?) so it&#38;#8217;s hard for me to dig up references or even make sense of it. However, I recently read an article from a couple months ago called <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Our-Digitally-Undying-Memories/63747/?sid=cr&#38;amp;utm_source=cr&#38;amp;utm_medium=en">Our Digitally Undying Memories</a> by Siva Vaidhyanathan, reviewing Viktor Mayer-Schönberger&#38;#8217;s book <em>Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age</em> that impacted me a lot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The technological proliferation of the last 40 years has given us remarkably cheap information-storage techniques. Our powers to remember have shifted the default (for digitized information and culture anyway) so that forgetting is the accident or exception, Mayer-Schönberger asserts. We have moved so quickly from forgetting most of our stuff (or at least rendering it hard to access) to remembering most of it (and making it easy to search) that we have neglected to measure the effects of the change. Just because we have the vessels, we fill them. Then we engage with networks of data communication that offer so many disparate elements of our lives to strangers and—more important—people we would like to know better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thought of print as something that goes away reminds me of a hilariously conspiracy-theory-esque Gawker post analyzing <a href="http://gawker.com/239404/why-your-new-york-times-mag-always-falls-apart">the strength of staples</a> used to bind <em>The New Yorker</em> versus <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could it be? Is the New York Times magazine perfectly calibrated to totally self-destruct before the next week&#38;#8217;s issue (and ads) arrives?</p>
  
  <p>Reached on Friday, a Times spokeswoman asked about reader staple angst denied everything. &#38;#8220;I&#38;#8217;ve never heard it,&#38;#8221; Diane McNulty said. &#38;#8220;In all the years I&#38;#8217;ve been here, I&#38;#8217;ve never heard that.&#38;#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we expand our idea of what a book is, a novel can be printed on newsprint and bound with staples, so can a blog. The new distinction is about formless vs. definite content and object vs. screen. All of these design and production options can—and should—apply to the future of books.</p>

<p>The fact that books can get ripped, left out in the rain, smudged with food, given to a friend, bought from a used bookstore with a stranger&#38;#8217;s marginalia, thrown away during a move, or left to rot in someone&#38;#8217;s dank basement is a design advantage—or, at the very least, something for the creator to take into account.</p>

<p>I love finely produced books**, where the designer has shaped the experience I will have with buying the book and reading it. But designers who consider books-of-the-future as important for being physical objects need to also think about redefining what a book is and how we interact with it. What paths might a reader take that deviate from the standard: author &#38;#8212;&#38;gt; printer &#38;#8212;&#38;gt; bookstore &#38;#8212;&#38;gt; reader?</p>

<p>There is magic in the kind of second-hand interactions (decaying, annotating, sharing) listed above that doesn&#38;#8217;t exist in the same way on a digital level. When the Microsoft Zune announced a feature called—wait for it—<em>squirting</em>, allowing you to wirelessly share songs from your device with others nearby, Steve Jobs had something brilliant to say about the artifice of digital relationships and interactions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Newsweek</strong>: Microsoft has announced its new iPod competitor, Zune. It says that this device is all about building communities. Are you worried?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Steve Jobs</strong>: In a word, no. I’ve seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three times. It takes forever. By the time you’ve gone through all that, the girl’s got up and left! You’re much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear. Then you’re connected with about two feet of headphone cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="http://number27.org/wb-builders.html"><em>World Building in a Crazy World</em></a>, Jonathan Harris writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human needs that have to do with authenticity, self-reflection, depth of communication, and real relationship-building are especially poorly answered online (at least currently). Maybe these needs cannot be answered online and require physical contact in all cases, but my sense is that they can, if only we design the right worlds to encourage and support them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The content of books is one of the most authentic ways that we get to explore these things—as <a href="http://notes.caseyagollan.com/post/102097321/fictions-about-what-it-is-to-be-a-fucking-human">DFW said</a>, &#38;#8220;Fiction&#38;#8217;s about what it is to be a fucking human being&#38;#8221;—but what about exploring meaning through the design of books? What about designing books to be kept or shared, protected or beat-up, resold and then shared and resold again? In Objectified, a designer from IDEO (can&#38;#8217;t remember exactly who it was) talked about sustainability as such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most things I’ve designed are now in landfills.&#38;#8221; I have to ask myself, &#38;#8220;Would you be comfortable having designed this product if it washed up on a beach?&#38;#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jumping again, but there is a parable that a Buddhist looks at a pile of trash and sees the trees and minerals that the garbage objects were originally made from and also the flower that will grow out of their decomposition. Maybe I&#38;#8217;m getting too specifically into this crazy idea of growing, decomposing, circulated books as interactive art objects, but these design considerations can be subtle too. How can we harness accidental design? How can we create objects that take on a second life beyond their content? What happens next? What I&#38;#8217;m really talking about is designing objects, and how we&#38;#8217;re only moving into increasingly exciting territory. And, yeah, I&#38;#8217;m <em>really freaking optimistic</em> about <strike>the future of print</strike> everything.</p>

<p><small>, I admire that the article is very focused, because there are <em>infinite</em> possibilities. My method of thinking and writing tends to be expansive, sprawling and often (because of this) indigestible.</small></p>

<p><small>*, I have three of the seven books that Craig highlights as excellent examples of print and can vouch that they are, in fact, excellent.</small></p>

<li>Tape a blank piece of paper to the wall.</li>
<li>Set up a projector to project the soundline interface onto your sheet of paper.</li>
<li>Select the audio that you wish to work with.</li>
<li>Press play, listen, and start taking notes or doodling as the projected line and timecode scan from left to right, in sync with the exact duration of the song.</li>

<p>Imagine that the paper represents the song as a timeline from the start (on the left) to the finish (on the right). The soundline helps you place your notes and doodles in the linear context of the song.
Want to remember a specific musical transition or recurring pattern? It’s easy and totally painless to capture the tiniest details and then return to them later. Simply make a dot or hatch mark on the page and write or draw a short reminder. When you want to return to this point to study it further, just use your computer to scrub through the song until the soundline is touching the mark. Hit play and observe your notes in sync with the sound.</p>

<p>Write, draw, paint, use different colors, paste stickers, draw connections, use graph paper. If something isn’t specifically related to a point on the timeline, nothing is stopping you from noting it anywhere you want at any time.</p>

<p>The simple animation transforms your blank piece of paper into a time-based notepad that allows for densely layered, unobtrusive, and organized annotating. Second-by-second.</p>

            A simple program, written in Processing, that generates compositions in the same geometric style as Joseph Albers, the famous color theorist. Whereas Albers&#38;#8217; compositions are carefully considered color studies, these color palettes are completely randomly generated. Can you tell the difference between Albers and Albers-O-Matic?

            <p>I don’t sketch all the time. So, as an artist, what do I do in my spare time?</p>

<ul>
<li>Think about things but let the thoughts pass rather than recording them,  </li>
<li>Get lost in concepts that I can’t make real,  </li>
<li>Voraciously consume books, magazines, and websites,  </li>
<li>Have conversations with people about art and life and whatever,  </li>
<li>Eat, sleep and or nap,  </li>
<li>Hug my dog, Miko,  </li>
<li>Design &#38;amp; edit a newspaper and art/literary magazine,  </li>
<li>Sometimes write in a notebook,  </li>
<li>Sometimes play a computer game,  </li>
<li>Not sketch.  </li>
<li>I have fumbled with numerous notebooks, sketchbooks, diaries, blogs, whatever.  </li>
<li>I know that keeping a sketchbook helps me to collect my visual thoughts and trace their evolution, and I enjoy finding the roots of an idea. - A good sketchbook can help me find out where an idea came from. A good sketchbook can show me how I develop. To show this, a good sketchbook needs to be consistent.  </li>
<li>I find it hard to be consistent without some kind of system. In seventeen years, I have almost never kept a good notebook/sketchbook.  </li>
<li>But that’s okay, because it takes alot of fumbling without a good system to figure out how a system should function.  </li>
<li>I enjoy creating and collaborating with systems. This is a new system, I will fill the same sheet out every day. Sometimes, at the end of the day, I won’t have anything interesting to say. And on certain days I won’t want to do this at all.  </li>
<li>But, I will do it every day, and worst case, if I forget or fall asleep or there is an earthquake, I will have to complete two sheets the next day.  </li>
<li>And so the parameters are set, let the sketching begin. The next sheet is a blank example of the form which I am to fill out every day.  </li>
</ul>

            <p>Garbage: a pile of bricks on the side of the road.<br />
Art: a pile of bricks on a pedestal in the Museum of Modern Art.</p>

<p>This is the power of context, something I grapple with not only in creating, but in viewing art.</p>

<p>“What is art?” this is an interminable debate that I don’t wish to go into here, but we know that at least one “condition” that makes art art is context.</p>

<p>One aspect of context is place: Earth, My Home, A Rainforest, The MoMA. These places help define the objects inside them: How do we approach them? What do they mean? But they also help define how we behave in relation to the space: Can I touch that painting? Can I take off my shoes?</p>

<p>What I am most interested in, however, is the power of an object to change the context of its own surroundings.</p>

<p>At the end of the summer, I spent a few days on the beach stacking rocks. Stacking rocks is a meditative process, and some would say an art unto itself. In a few days, my little sister, a friend, and I had created about twenty stacked rock towers in a small area of the beach.</p>

<p>When I returned to the beach a few days later some stacks were knocked over and some stacks were still standing, but I also found something unexpected—new stacks. An upside down beer bottle, pushed into the sand, was the base. On top of that was placed a vertical rock supported by sticks. I kept returning to the spot every few days to find something new. One day, I returned to find every single stack knocked down and combined into a giant rock pile. I couldn’t help but think, “what a beautiful new piece!” After the stacks were gone, nobody knew what to do with the space and my sculpture park slowly faded away. I couldn’t help but feel good because I hadn’t expected anyone else to run with my idea, and to respond to the small change in context that I had made.</p>

<p>I had transformed a beach scattered with stones into a man-made sculpture park. What I didn’t intend was for the sculptures to transform the beach into a public art studio, and for the experience of stacking rocks to transform my thinking as an artist.</p>

   <title>Process Magazine</title>

            <p>I wanted a good reason to talk to everyone again about the things that matter and to let the conversation wander into wonderfully unexpected places. So in the last week of May I put out a call on Facebook to a bunch of different artist friends for a few images and a short text, then began recording and transcribing conversations.</p>

<p>The idea for Process came to me while I was in the shower. I wondered, “What are my friends working on?” Facebook makes it easy for me to stay in the loop about what my friends are up to, when their birthdays are approaching, and which Jonas brother they are most like, but it makes it harder to talk about meaningful things. Because I know what you ate for dinner yesterday, we no longer need to get on the phone or—drumroll please—sit down and just talk.</p>

<p>I wanted a good reason to talk to everyone again about the things that matter and to let the conversation wander into wonderfully unexpected places. So in the last week of May I put out a call on Facebook to a bunch of different artist friends for a few images and a short text, then began recording and transcribing conversations. All conversations happened either in person or over the phone because I have a sneaking suspicion that when using email or IM people think way too hard about what they’re trying to say—or not at all.</p>

<p>The first issue of Process is based entirely around these recorded conversations. They begin and end abruptly, go off on tangents, and occasionally become incoherent. And that’s what I love about them. In each conversation, both sides are pushing and racking their brains to make sense of it all. These are the types of conversations that you wish you had written down. Now the thoughts are no longer fleeting.</p>

<p>This first iteration of Process has come together in magazine form but I didn’t just set out to make a magazine. My broader goal is to connect all the artists, philosophers, and creative minds I know (and soon enough the ones that I don’t yet know!), and to keep a dialogue going about what creativity means today. That means I need your help and participation!</p>

            <p>Thought webs show the structure of how we think. One of these thought webs is a thought, the other is just a drawing. So which is which? Can you tell? Does it matter? What happens if instead of letting our thoughts define their structure, we define the structure before the thought?</p>

            <h2>Statement</h2>

<p>Tasked with a month long exploration of an unanswerable question, I read a book, two plays, and scoured strange corners of the Internet. I immersed myself in the philosophies of Existentialism and Absurdism. I amassed pages of research and discovered that I love researching. Within hours, I rejected my initial ideas and exploded my thinking in every direction. This piece was almost blatant: existence, perception, choice, and intention. I kept worrying about having the time to make something imposing until, through conversations with others, I realized that I didn’t need impose. I could simply do something, such as hand over a signed affidavit for a conversation. This delighted me. I saw Lawrence Weiner’s text-heavy retrospective at the Whitney in New York, and again, I was delighted by it. Thinking, writing, speaking, doing as art. Everything I create is a manifestation of what I have put into my mind. So, I let this piece come naturally to me. I imagined a place to think. It came to me in a daydream. Instead of reaching a false conclusion, I created a context for further discussion. The sculpture is just an object, the concept and the conversation, the intangibles, are the art. It’s okay to not have, and not want, a concrete opinion. My beliefs are strong, yet constantly changing and I hope that that never stops. I don’t just want to talk about my piece, I want to talk inside it, or beside it, with you. I want it to be a lens through which we can look at and talk about about existence, perception, choice, and intention.</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>This outdoor installation, constructed December 2007, was my final project at the Oxbow School. The sculpture hangs from a tree and descends to the ground, creating a space large enough that about 5 -10 participants may enter and see the world around them diffused through the material. Inside is an intimate environment for discussion that responds to every breath of of the wind. The space is truly ethereal. The material is one large sheet of plastic constructed by overlapping layers of industrial stretch wrap. For the most part, the stretch wrap clings to itself, but small portions and the seam of the walls were fixed with spray adhesive. Dimensions of the uninstalled sheet of plastic are roughly 25 x 40 ft.</p>

            It is made entirely out of salvaged materials. The structure is 3 bamboo poles I found behind a shed and the walls are made of tyvek and plastic bags zip-tied and stapled together. The walls acted like sails and caught enough wind to bring the teepee to the ground almost every night, but the resilient bamboo and plastic structure rarely needed mending. At the center of the structure hung a plum bob pendulum, but I planned to replace it with a chandelier. One night we projected a film about bees backwards onto a wall of the teepee and lay inside watching it. Looking back, it was definitely a precursor to my <a href="http://caseyagollan.com/2007/final-project">Oxbow Final Project</a>.

            From here I became interested in how people move in set routes. For example, you can find your way around your house with your eyes closed. Even on these mats you can see how people enter and exit buildings at similar and consistent angles.
